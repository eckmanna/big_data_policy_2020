On Thursday night police removed and arrested two Greenpeace activists who had spent over 70 hours blocking the rig from leaving Cromarty Firth, north of Inverness, Scotland, Greenpeace said in a statement.   “We can’t give up and let oil giants carry on with business as usual because that means giving up on a habitable planet and our kids’ future,” said Greenpeace UK’s executive director, John Sauven.  Two more Greenpeace activists climbed up a leg of the rig in the early hours of Friday, the group said, adding it is organizing shifts for its climbers in its effort to prevent BP from drilling its Vorlich field.  Police have arrested nine people in connection with the protest, Scottish police said, adding they were working with the operators of the rig to reach a “safe resolution to the continuing protest”.      BP said in a statement it was coordinating with rig-owner Transocean and Scottish police.   “BP supports debate, discussion and peaceful demonstration, but the irresponsible actions of this group are putting themselves and others unnecessarily at risk, while ignoring court orders and police action,” the company said.  The Vorlich field, a relatively small development thought to contain 30 million barrels of oil, is due to come onstream in 2020. BP is working on the project together with Ithaca Energy, a unit of Israel’s Delek Group poised for a stock market listing.

1,2017-09-01 00:00:00,2017,9.0,1,Mia Jankowicz,"At BP-Sponsored Art Show, Protesters Call Out the Corporation’s Abuses","On Thursday evening at the National Portrait Gallery, protesters drew attention to BP’s work with the Indonesian government, which has been accused of civil rights violations in West Papua. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads LONDON — The National Portrait Gallery’s annual portrait prize exhibition gained an extra exhibit last night thanks to an intervention by BP or Not BP?, an anti-British Petroleum (BP) artist protest group. The BP Portrait Prize is an annual public competition that has run for 37 years and has been sponsored by BP since 1990. The protest was one of many staged events against BP’s involvement in the arts in recent years by BP or not BP? and other members of the Art Not Oil Coalition. In the hall just outside the exhibition space, BP or not BP? unveiled a portrait of Benny Wenda, a West Papuan independence leader exiled in the UK. Wenda is the face of a struggle that protesters claim has been ignored by BP. “It felt good to do something not only about BP’s impact on climate change, but also the human rights aspects,” Lianna Etkind, a participant in the protest, told me. “Companies like BP are complicit in people losing their land from flooding resulting from climate change, but also complicit in acts of direct oppression.” BP works closely with the Indonesian government to extract West Papuan natural resources such as liquefied natural gas. There is a strong liberation movement in West Papua, the western half of the island of New Guinea, to gain independence as a nation, as the Indonesian government has claimed it a province of its country since 1963. According to a statement given by Wenda, “BP is operating in the middle of a genocide. Since 1963, hundreds of thousands of West Papuans have been killed by the Indonesian occupation, either directly by government forces or through the loss of their homes, their lands and their livelihoods. The money that BP pays to the Indonesian government helps them to buy weapons and ammunition that are used to harass, intimidate and kill my people.” The portrait was displayed next to the “morning star” flag, used by West Papuan independence supporters but which is banned by Indonesia. Dale Grimshaw, the painter of the portrait, had submitted his painting of Benny Wenda to the competition as a form of protest, but it was not selected. He explained his decision to protest the exhibition in an impromptu talk to gallery-goers. He said: “[BP] know very well what’s going on in the land, they engage politically and financially speaking with the Indonesian military … could you imagine, on a weekly basis, people you know being imprisoned and tortured for peaceful protest?” He also said in a statement: “BP gets to plaster its logo all over the gallery and present this false version of itself to the world. Art can be a way to fight back against that and tell the truth about what these companies are really doing.” The intervention was timed to happen on the same day as the submission to the UN of a 140,000-strong international petition calling for a free and fair independence vote for the people of West Papua. After the portrait was unveiled, the group screened a short video of Wenda and performed a mini “awards ceremony” presenting prizes for “biggest hypocrite” and “biggest polluter” to the “Director of the National Portrait Gallery” and a “BP representative” respectively. The charge of hypocrisy stems from the National Portrait Gallery’s Ethical Fundraising Policy, released via a Freedom of Information request made by Culture Unstained, which states concern over accepting funds from anyone “known or suspected to be closely associated with a regime known or suspected to be in violation of human rights.” The National Portrait Gallery does not publicly state how much money it receives from BP, but it is a share of the £7.5 million five-year deal between the National Portrait Gallery and three other British cultural institutions. BP or not BP? point out that a quarter of this amount would be less than 2% of the gallery’s annual income. Hyperallergic reached out to the National Portrait Gallery for comment but as of this writing has received no response. BP’s relationship with Indonesia as well as other repressive governments are currently the subject of a formal complaint to the National Portrait Gallery by the campaign group Culture Unstained, who, along with BP or not BP?, are part of the Art Not Oil Coalition. The BP or not BP? protest took place at the National Portrait Gallery (St. Martin’s Pl, London) on Thursday, August 31.  Correction: A previous version of this article stated BP or not BP? had requested a Freedom of Information request from the National Gallery’s Ethical Fundraising Policy. This is incorrect; Culture Unstained had made the request. This has been fixed.",https://hyperallergic.com/398689/bp-or-not-bp-national-portrait-gallery-protest/,,Hyperallergic

The activists demanded that one of the world’s biggest energy companies immediately end drilling new wells and invest only in renewable energy or shut its operations and return cash to investors.   Greenpeace said in a statement that a team of activists in boats drew up besides the 27,000-tonne rig as it was trying to leave Cromarty Firth.   The statement quoted a Greenpeace activist from Scotland it identified as Jo as saying: “This rig and the 30 million barrels it seeks to drill, are a sure a sign that BP are committed to business as usual, fueling a climate emergency that threatens millions of lives and the future of the living world.”  BP said in a statement: “While we recognize the right for peaceful protest, the actions of this group are irresponsible and may put themselves and others unnecessarily at risk.”   The company said it was working with Transocean Ltd, the rig’s owner and operator, and other authorities to resolve the situation.  BP added that it shared the protesters’ concerns about climate and that it supported the Paris climate agreement.   Responding to BP’s statement, Greenpeace said that while the rig was owned by Transocean, it was on its way to the Vorlich field to drill new oil wells operated by BP.  Last month, Greenpeace activists blocked BP’s London headquarters in St James’ Square in central London, demanding the company end its oil exploration.

The high-sea chase is the latest step in Greenpeace’s nine-day effort to stop the 40,000 tonne Paul Loyd JNR rig from reaching the Vorlich oilfield to start its drilling campaign.  The vessel left Cromarty Firth, north of Inverness, Scotland on Friday after police twice removed activists who had climbed and spent several days on one of the rig’s legs.  But it was forced to turn away twice from its destination over the past 48 hours as Greenpeace’s Arctic Sunrise vessel followed it, the activist group said.  The Paul Loyd JNR is currently heading west toward Peterhead and away from the Vorlich field, according to Greenpeace and www.marinetraffic.com ship tracking website.  “We are determined to stop BP drilling new oil wells in the North Sea,” Sarah North, Greenpeace International climate activist on the Arctic Sunrise said in a statement.  BP slammed Greenpeace and said it had secured an injunction against the Arctic Sunrise.      “Given Greenpeace’s repeated interference and reckless actions directed at our lawful business and their continued illegal defiance of court orders and police action, we have ... this injunction as a precautionary measure to protect the safety of people and operations,” a BP spokesman said in a statement.      BP announced last year plans to invest 200 million pounds  ($251.16 million) to develop the Vorlich field in the central North Sea which holds some 30 million barrels of oil and gas equivalent.  It is expected to start production in 2020 with an output of 20,000 barrels per day, according to BP’s website.

5,2019-06-26 00:00:00,2019,6.0,26,Ron Bousso,BP gets back into animal feed with $30 million Calysta investment,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP is returning to the animal feed business a quarter of a century after exiting the sector.  The London-based oil and gas company said it is investing $30 million in Calysta Inc., which produces protein for fish, livestock and pet food.  Natural gas is pumped through a fermenter, and the microorganisms, from naturally occurring microbes found in soil, metabolize the gas as their sole source of energy, producing a high-protein biomass.  While a relatively large investment for BP’s venture division, which typically puts money into new technologies focused on the transition to low-carbon energy, it is small fry for a company that announced a $2.4 billion profit for the first quarter.  The oil giant, which has come under increasing pressure from climate activists, has been working with shareholders in recent years to try to define a path towards meeting the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement to limit global warming.  Calysta could, however, become an important buyer of gas for BP as demand for protein-based animal feed is expected to rise by 80% by 2050 as the world’s population grows and diets change, BP’s vice president for long-term planning Dominic Emery said.  “This could become a reasonably material part of our gas supply business over time,” Emery told Reuters. The business is expected to generate profits for BP in the next few years, he added.  The technology may help meet the growing demand for feed in a more sustainable way by using less water and agricultural land.  California-based Calysta operates a production facility in Teesside in eastern England.  BP and peers including Royal Dutch Shell and Total are betting on growing demand for natural gas, the least polluting fossil fuel, as the world transitions to cleaner forms of energy.  While most of the gas is consumed for power and heating, the companies are also looking for other outlets such as truck and marine transportation and industries.  BP built in the 1980s a sprawling nutrition business with products ranging from pet food to fish farms. It sold most of the struggling division by 1994 for over $1.5 billion in order to focus on its oil and gas business.  BP Venture’s senior principal David Hayes will take a seat on the board of Calysta, BP said.

Woodfibre said on Wednesday BP Gas Marketing Limited had agreed to buy 0.75 million tonnes per year (mtpa) of LNG for 15 years starting in 2023, when the project in British Columbia is expected to come onstream.  The facility’s capacity is expected to be 2.1 mtpa.  It said it was also working on an agreement “for BP Canada to provide gas transportation and balancing services ensuring a reliable delivery of gas to the Woodfibre LNG export facility over the 15-year term”.  Dozens of companies are planning LNG export terminals in North America to capitalize on gas made accessible from shale drilling technology. Signing up committed, long-term buyers is vital for financing and building such projects.  Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) approved its 14 mtpa project in Kitimat, northern British Columbia, in October, triggering a new cycle of projects to be built to meet an anticipated LNG shortage in mid-2020s.  But the LNG Canada project is the only one in Canada to have progressed to construction stage.   Woodfibre LNG is a subsidiary of Pacific Oil & Gas, part of the Singaporean conglomerate RGE. Pacific Oil & Gas operates two LNG import terminals in China, as well as other upstream and midstream oil and gas assets.  LNG produced on the west coast of Canada is likely to be sold in Asia which accounts for about 75 percent of global demand. There are at least half a dozen LNG export terminal projects planned in Canada, and more in the United States.

Rylance, who trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, was the first artistic director of Shakespeare’s Globe in London, between 1995 and 2005. Today, the Oscar winner announced his decision to leave the RSC in a Guardian opinion article, explaining his need to sever ties with the company that has inspired him since his teenage years, “not because it is any less of a theatre company, but because of the company it keeps.” In 2012, when the RSC initiated its partnership with BP, Rylance was among the signees of a letter to the company expressing concern that it was “allowing itself to be used by BP to obscure the destructive reality of its activities.” That year, activist theatre group BP or not BP? launched a series of satirical, performance-based protests, which have continued ever since. This year, the group also led protests at the National Portrait Gallery and British Museum, urging them to sever their financial ties with BP. The RSC later decided to remove BP’s logos from its plays, but the next year, worked with the oil company to sponsor a reduced ticket program for young adults between 16 and 25. In 2016, the RSC signed a contract to continue the program through 2022. Rylance urges the company to ends this relationship much sooner, writing: The RSC is well placed to make a positive statement about the responsibility of cultural organisations to act on the climate crisis. It could turn this situation on its head and give young people much more value than a cheap £5 ticket. It could give them the support of Shakespeare in their stand against our addiction to energy dealers who would willingly destroy us for a quick quid. He has instead expressed his support for Culture Unstained’s Fossil Free £5 Ticket project, which crowdfunds to finance the reduced admission program. Rylance said he met with environmentalist Jonathon Porritt to better understand BP’s role in climate change, to which Porritt told him: Together with other oil majors, BP has been accused of fully understanding the science of climate change as far back as the early 1980s, and downplaying and obscuring that science ever since, always in the short-term interests of its shareholders. Regrettably, its current leadership is stuck in the same pattern — all the time using philanthropy to hide its past and present culpability. “BP is also a powerful lobbyist,” Rylance writes. “It recently topped the list of firms obstructing climate action around the world and has been successfully lobbying President Trump for access to Arctic oil.” In a longer version of the article published by Culture Unstained, Rylance claims that during an annual general meeting of the RSC in 2017, he asked about the sponsorship and was promised that RSC’s Associate Artists would be further involved in the company’s charitable objectives through “private consultation.” “Hearing nothing, I recently let the RSC know that I feel I must resign as I do not wish to be associated with BP any more than I would with an arms dealer, a tobacco salesmen or any company or individual who willfully destroys the lives of others alive and unborn,” he continues. “Nor do I believe would William Shakespeare.” “We are all together in this crisis and we all must change. I am resigning to lend strength to the voices within the RSC who want to be progressive, and to encourage my fellow associates to express themselves, too.” At the time of writing, Hyperallergic has not received a response to its request for comment from the RSC.",https://hyperallergic.com/506390/mark-rylance-resigns-royal-shakespeare-company/,,Hyperallergic

After obtaining internal documents through the Freedom of Information Act, the Art Not Oil coalition claims that BP “influenced curatorial decision-making, shaped cultural institutions’ security strategies and used museums to further its political interests in the UK and abroad,” as the Guardian, which received the documents, reported. Emails show that the oil and gas company allegedly had final say over the purchase and inclusion of an artwork by painters from the indigenous Australian Spinifex group in the British Museum exhibition Indigenous Australia: enduring civilization, which coincided with BP’s push last year to drill in the Great Australian Bight. The company, in response, said it “never seeks curatorial influence” and was merely providing funding. Last year, it apparently wanted to place its logo on the cover of a forthcoming National Portrait Gallery book; an email reveals one employee backing off after some back-and-forth with the museum’s director of communications. BP brushed off the incident as “a discussion between partners on how to demonstrate that partnership on a relevant product.” The company also seems to have pressured both museums to enroll staff in a counterterrorism training program it had organized, as well as requested that a number of arts institutions send it information on whether any employees were part of unions that might oppose oil industry sponsorship of the arts. No documents regarding Tate, which BP will cease sponsoring next year, are specifically mentioned. “We’ve always known that BP uses sponsorship deals to buy a social legitimacy that it doesn’t deserve,” Chris Garrard, a member of Art Not Oil and the lead author of its report on BP’s influence, told the Guardian. “But now we have specific evidence of where our museums and galleries have been complicit in advancing BP’s business interests and keeping the voices of the company’s critics in check. “How can we have trust in these institutions when they have repeatedly put BP’s needs before the public good?” The National Portrait Gallery and the British Museum have denied facing such pressures from the oil company. According to the Guardian, BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley just this month defended his firm’s funding of the arts at an annual general meeting, asserting that the partnerships have “no strings attached.” The Museums Association, which represents museums and galleries in the UK, may now look into the case, as any claims proven true violate its code of ethics. Article 1.2, for instance, dictates that all who work in and with museums should “ensure editorial integrity in programming and interpretation. Resist attempts to influence interpretation or content by particular interest groups, including lenders, donors and funders.” If Art Not Oil requests further guidance on the situation, the association’s ethics committee will follow up on the claims and contact all parties involved, a policy officer told the Guardian.",https://hyperallergic.com/295105/documents-hint-at-bps-undue-influence-on-uk-museums-it-sponsors/,,Hyperallergic

Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads In June, the New Zealand artist Henry Christian-Slane received £7,000 (~$9,240) when his painting won the BP Young Artist Award, one of the prizes given as part of the annual BP Portrait Award hosted by the National Portrait Gallery (NPG) in London. Today, he announced that he would be giving a portion of that prize money to Greenpeace, to protest the award’s role in promoting the controversial oil company’s image. “It’s a prestigious award, and I was happy to receive it, but I’m not happy about being part of BP’s PR strategy,” the 26-year-old wrote in a guest post on Greenpeace UK’s website. “And so as a symbolic act, I am donating £1,000 of their prize money directly to Greenpeace projects that aim to protest BP’s further extraction of fossil fuels from the Earth. I hope this action will help keep the issue of BP’s role in climate change from being overshadowed by their contribution to the arts.” Protestors, namely those belonging to the Art Not Oil coalition, have long called for the NPG to end its sponsorship deal with BP. They argue that such deals provide “cheap PR” for the oil giant as BP continues deepwater drilling projects despite detrimental effects on the environment as well as on local communities affected by this work. In June, the research group Culture Unstained published a report that outlined the company’s multiple connections to foreign regimes that violate human rights in countries from Azerbaijan to Indonesia. Artist protest group BP or not BP? emphasized some of these violations in a protest it staged last week. One could argue that an artist opposed to BP’s sponsorship of the contest should perhaps not have entered it in the first place. The museum puts out an open call every year for anyone 18 and over to participate in the contest, which has an entry fee of £40; Christian-Slane’s oil portrait of his partner, “Gabi,” was one of 2,580 entries submitted for this year’s Portrait Award, which also grants money to first, second, and third place winners of the eponymous prize as well as to one winner in a third category. Hyperallergic reached out to Christian-Slane about why he ultimately decided to submit his work but did not receive a response. This is not the first time the prize has been the subject of protest, although others in the past have taken a more dramatic route: in 2015, masked men attempted to remove an oil painting from the gallery wall in what was reportedly “a hoax heist in an apparent protest” against BP’s sponsorship of the portrait award. As for the rest of Christian-Slane’s prize money, he notes in his post for Greenpeace that he will be using it to make art “as a way to effect positive change and contribute to culture.” His portrait is on display at the museum, along with other winning paintings, through September 24.",https://hyperallergic.com/399742/winner-of-a-bp-portrait-award-donates-share-of-prize-money-to-anti-bp-protests/,,Hyperallergic

The agreement provided just a tiny fraction of the annual operating budget for the British museums group — which operates Tate Britain and Tate Modern in London, as well as Tate Liverpool and Tate St. Ives — but gave the oil giant extensive public exposure and positive brand associations through events and exhibitions, like Tate Britain’s BP Walk through British Art and the BP Art Exchange program. But in 2010, after the founding of the artist collective Liberate Tate during a workshop on art and activism at Tate, the sponsorship deal became an increasingly controversial subject of public debate. Over the course of the past six years, members of Liberate Tate — in concert with other cultural activist organizations — staged a series of performances and protests demanding an end to the sponsorship deal. Most of the actions took the form of unsanctioned performances inside Tate Modern and Tate Britain, from a miniature oil spill at the institution’s summer gala (“License to Spill,” 2010) to attempting to gift the museum a 54-foot-long wind turbine blade (“The Gift,” 2012) and setting up a tattoo parlor in the galleries, where each performer was tattooed with the atmosphere’s carbon dioxide level the year she was born (“Birthmark,” 2015). When the decision to end the agreement was made public, Liberate Tate had been preparing for its most elaborate and confrontational series of actions and performances as BP and Tate considered whether or not to renew their agreement for another five years. Though staff of BP and Tate were quick to assert that the protest performances and souring public opinion of the fossil fuel industry had nothing to do with the decision, Liberate Tate considers the decision a great victory. With BP on its way out at Tate, energy and momentum are shifting to ridding four other major London cultural institutions (the British Museum, the National Portrait Gallery, the National Theatre, and the Royal Opera House) of the oil company. Hyperallergic spoke with Mel Evans and Kevin Smith, two longtime members of Liberate Tate, about the collective’s development during its six-year campaign, how it planned its most iconic performances, and what’s next now that Tate has been liberated. *   *   * Benjamin Sutton: Did you have any inkling the decision to end the sponsorship was coming? Mel Evans: Completely took us by surprise. We went into this year expecting that we’d have to wait until the end of the year for the announcement to come, and that was really weighing on us because we had that sense of, “Oh, you know, it could be that we get there, but it could be that we find out there’s another five years.” Those two extremes were weighing on our souls. Then for it to come so soon in the year feels like this crazy sort of relief. Kevin Smith: We were fully expecting that we’d have to just escalate it like nobody’s business over the course of this year, because we felt like discussions were being made hurriedly, but more ongoing and weren’t necessarily definitive at this point. We had a whole bunch of plans of how we felt we needed to go in a more determined fashion. BS: Was there a turning point in your campaign or a moment when it seemed like Liberate Tate’s message really started to gain traction? KS: I would say the first point of traction would be the Tate Summer Party, where we did the “License to Spill” performance. That garnered an awful lot of international media and felt like it was really putting it on the map. I think there was a sense of, we can do this, and then all of a sudden at the end of that year is when they announced the five-year deal renewal. At that point there was enough motivation and energy and creative satisfaction for people to pull together and hunker down in a war of attrition with Tate. And with a lot of the performances after that, it felt like we got more into a groove of what we were doing, how we were executing it, and what we were putting out there. It was only in the last year that we started having discussions about what it would mean for us on a personal, emotional, political, and creative level if BP did renew the five-year sponsorship. ME: They had a tough year in 2010. It was, for them, sudden and awful, and it was such a crystallization of the problem — the fact that they were having this party in June 2010, celebrating 20 years of BP sponsorship, while the Deepwater Horizon spill was ongoing. The press hits to our interventions there were just off the scale. So they issued that five-year deal as a kind of threat to us, saying, “Well, we’re staying around, you could never last this out.” And I think they really thought at that point that in five years time it would’ve all cooled off. That was the challenge that we took, in a way, like, “Actually, yeah, we will.” And for those five years, we slowly but surely built, grew, and escalated our tactics, to the point where last year we were staying overnight in the gallery, we were tattooing each other in the gallery. I think they thought their five-year deal would ward us off, and they weren’t successful in that. KS: They hadn’t banked on us increasingly getting off on it. (Laughs.) ME: But was there a moment when we thought that we could do this? In a sense, I think, we always did, because you have to, don’t you? Even when it seemed despairing and it seemed like, “Oh god, there aren’t that many people gonna show up this time.” Or when it’s really hard to organize or you plan something and they install something by surprise — it’s all happened. I think we’ve always had that conviction that we can do this and we will do this, and we’ll keep doing it for as long as it takes to do it. We were dredging into our inner souls to find the next five years in us, but we were going to find it. I think that’s when we can win, when they realize that we’ve got more stamina than they do. KS: I think also this whole thing with oil companies is that question of being on the wrong side of history. In 2011 we made a publication called Not If But When: Culture Beyond Oil, because oil companies are going to be seen as such despicable entities for what they’ve done. So our sense is that it will happen at some point, and what we’re doing is trying to hasten that procedure and ramp up the stigmatization of oil companies as soon as possible in order to diminish the political, financial, and cultural power that they have over society. BS: What was the process like, on the inside, when Liberate Tate conceived, planned, and carried out an action? ME: It’s certainly changed over the years, and evolved over the years. At the beginning, we were much looser and kind of finding out — maybe we’ll try this over here, maybe we’ll try that over there — and then as time went by, we became so much more intimate with those spaces and how to make work for those spaces. We also pushed ourselves further in terms of how to be confrontational in those spaces. We also became a lot faster with our aesthetic. It’s not like we ever worked on one thing at a time and then either put it out into the world when we as artists thought that it was ready, or only for a specific date and around a specific event. We were holding those two ways of working hand in hand, so that we’d have things bubbling up and evolving, and we tried to feel when the right moment was to do them. So much had evolved through that process that many of the pieces really changed and evolved through a process of questioning and reevaluating for a different situation. There’s been a whole evolution of our practice and that’s one of the things that’s very much alive for us at the moment — how to continue that practice because we’ve spent this much time, invested this much effort, in really honing the way that we work together and trusting that that will really bear fruit. KS: It’s a weird alchemy of trust that we’ve developed as a group, where everyone’s happy to not fix things or have a fixed idea, and things shift about and evolve, with a lot of “How about this, or how about this, and what if we did that?” To me, for most of the performances, it’s felt like at some point it suddenly clicked in a collective way, where everyone suddenly felt, “OK, that’s the thing,” and then we’d go full steam ahead in executing it, or recruiting people for it, or making it happen. It’s felt like a very fluid development until all of a sudden people go, “OK, that’s the idea.” ME: As for some of those nuts and bolts questions, we have a tighter list for core organizing, which is about 15 people, and that is an email list that’s used everyday. We then have smaller, WhatsApp groups for specific projects — that’s a lot more than once a day. We all work full-time as well. Last year we were having meetings two weekend afternoons a month and two weekday evenings a month; and for the three month lead-up to big performances, breakfast meetings once a week, so quite a lot of contact. And that was about distributing out the creative process so that it had enough space for the ideas to grow, separating that out from the more administrative, keeping everything moving as fast as we logistically needed to. There are about 500 people who’ve been involved in different performances, some more regularly than others, so there’s quite a tight network of trust and then there’s the wider Liberate Tate network, you know. All those people are part of Liberate Tate, but we would only communicate with them via post. KS: By love letters. Because it’s usually quite a big task, it’s a relationship of trust. People get to know our work. We’re essentially pulling people relatively out of the blue, saying, “Do you want to come and be involved in doing this thing?” And that thing might be quite confrontational; it might involve the possibility of arrest; it might be durational, with a rehearsal beforehand. So it’s quite a lot that we’re asking of people, so the idea with putting a lot of effort into the love letter is not just a security concern of keeping everything off email and phones, but also to make an experiential beginning of someone’s journey of participating in our performance. In fact someone came up to me when we were all at the pub after the party that we had in Tate Modern on Saturday [March 19], and said, “I’m going to keep those love letters forever, they were really special.” So that’s part of how we tried to plan and engage with people before things. And apart from all the weekly meetings, every summer we’ve had a two-day camping retreat outside of London. BS: When you started out, this type of protest art was not exactly unheard of, but certainly more unusual than it is now. People and groups are being much more vocal and creative in their criticisms of museums — whether it be about turning down funds from climate change deniers, demanding better labor practices, or refusing sponsorship from dangerous companies. Has that made it more difficult to stand out or get your message across? KS: I think what’s interesting is seeing how each group is really tailoring its practice to be more impactful or affective or coherent with the institution that they’re challenging. That’s also created a difference in feel, texture, and performance. I don’t think it’s ever really felt like there’s a competition or a crowding out of the marketplace of these types of interventions because they’ve all taken such different forms and aesthetics and so on. BS: Speaking of aesthetics, Liberate Tate has so convincingly adopted the aesthetics of Tate and, in some cases, BP, in its performances and actions. What informed that strategy? ME: There is a tendency toward taking a target’s logo, taking the BP logo and doing something to it, attacking it in some way, and that process of taking their visual identity and messing with it somehow will achieve messing with the organization itself. When in fact, I feel like any time that you replicate your target’s logo, your target’s visual identity, you reinforce them, you reinforce their messaging. BP’s been through a massive renewal process with its visual identity. It used to have this coat of arms that was a very old, empire, British look. And then it had its revamp in 2002 with the “helios,” this sun-god kind of flower, that’s very symbolic of renewable energy, which they then cancelled any attempt to go near, and stuck with the opposite. Their visual identity and what they’re trying to do in terms of reinterpreting themselves for the 21st century is very strong, it’s great PR. For us to reinforce that in any way would be terrible, we should stay away from it. The only times we’ve echoed it in our work, there’s been the oil canisters as this reference to who’s spilling, who’s making the mess, and placing them as a villain in our visual narrative, or we’ve had these moments where we’ve created a black helios out of black paint, or we’ve created another black helios out of the all-black sleeping bags in “Time Piece.” So we’ve had these echoes of it, to refer to it but to refer to it differently, not to reinforce it. Then what we do instead is embrace the visual identity of Tate, and that’s because we do want to embrace the parts of Tate that we do love, the parts of Tate that we do want to support and protect, which are around the publicness and the openness to debate that’s potentially there in that public space. When we reinforce Tate’s visual identity by using its fonts and adapting its logos to ours, or just applying its logo guidelines to ours, then we reinforce the thing that we are trying to protect, and that’s the public and the art, and all those things that we are preserving. KS: It’s a funny dynamic because in so many of the performances, there’s obviously the confrontation, the taking of space, doing something that’s kind of confrontational in the space, but there’s also the fact that it blends in so well with what might be happening at Tate as some kind of engaging spectacle that people, a lot of the time, presume it’s part of the programming rather than something that’s unsolicited. For us I think that’s quite a fruitful area to be operating in, because it’s that sort of “neither this nor that,” uncategorizable, weird middle ground, where I think the interesting reactions take place. ME: Which goes to the heart of the whole strategy in a way, which is that we’re always inside and outside. We’re not so far out that we can be ignored, but we’re not so far inside that we have no leverage — we’re in this powerful limbo. KS: Apart from using the Tate aesthetic, the Tate logo, and those other aspects of Tate, there’s also the cooptation of the Tate buildings themselves, because they are physically really incredible spaces, and they’ve just been really rich and giving to us in terms of different locations and different possibilities for us to engage with aspects of those different space with pop-up performances. ME: A couple of us actually took a course at Tate that was entirely focused on artworks made for the Turbine Hall, because it’s one of our favorite spaces. We’ve engaged on a very deep level with making work for that space. BS: What steps has Liberate Tate taken in its various actions and undertakings to make clear that what you’re opposing is not Tate itself, but BP’s sponsorship of Tate — a distinction that often gets lost in more sensationalist press coverage? ME: It’s a tricky one, isn’t it? We’ve had to, I think, strike a balance between making it clear that we are about Tate, want to protect it, those things, but also challenging them and making them feel uncomfortable as well. This friendly critic role where, “Yeah, we really like you, but also, you need to do something about this really soon, please.” It’s that tricky balance where we almost have to counter out one message with the other. Because if it seems like we’re being too, “Oh, they’re just so fine and so good,” then that wouldn’t work. Or if it’s too hard the other way, that wouldn’t work either. It can be useful if in the press it’s presented as we’re really confrontational with them, because that is part of the tactic. One example would be us handing out letters to staff during “Time Piece.” It’s this question of pushing the uncomfortableness right up to the top so that it was the directorship that was in the difficult position of deciding whether or not to ask the police to forcibly remove us. Whereas with the floor-level staff, we had written letters to them explaining what we were doing. We were having nice chats with them. Placing that discomfort in the right place has been important. KS: Also, the whole last six years of what we’ve been doing has taken place against a backdrop of government cuts to arts funding. We’ve made sure that we’ve including messaging and engaged with the various groups to articulate why there’s a real need for art, for public funding, and for arts bodies like Tate to be maintained. There shouldn’t be this either-or dichotomy. BS: Now that BP has been expelled, does Tate have other corporate sponsors we should be worried about and calling out? KS: The most recent corporate sponsor that was announced for Tate was Uniqlo, the clothing company. They have a whole host of ongoing labor issues in China. So there’s lots of people who are concerned with workers rights in the fashion industry who would take issue with Uniqlo sponsorship. I think these are all valid questions and people should talk about issues with Uniqlo sponsorship. To me personally, my motivation and what makes big oil so unacceptable, is the rapidly shrinking time frame we have to deal with climate change. To me that’s a defining line of what makes a corporate sponsor totally unacceptable versus up for rigorous discussion and questioning. Uniqlo has the opportunity to resolve its labor disputes or to improve its labor practices in a satisfactory way, to benefit their workers. BP has a fixed identity of trashing the planet and it structurally can’t do anything else. ME: I do think the reason why we focused on the oil industry is the same reason why the oil industry is losing so much public support — especially considering how much it had. I think there is something distinctive not only about our motivation but also about the wider cultural position of the industry. The coal industry now wouldn’t dare do cultural sponsorship, because it’s just going to get attacked, and the oil industry is in that process of losing that potential to appear in public spaces without fear of retribution. It’s going the way of tobacco. BS: What might some of the performances that you had planned for Tate this year have looked like? ME: One of them we managed to incorporate into the party on [March 19]. We’ve known that we had this opportunity within the architecture of the building that at some point, when the moment was right escalation-wise, we would utilize. There’s this gate to the roof, which Tate really didn’t know about. They were genuinely asking us “How on Earth did you do that?” We had that as an option that we’d been planning to use this year, and which we did use, because we threw 10 kilograms of black confetti down during the party. So we did get to use one of the tricks we had up our sleeves.  To mark the success of its campaign — and cover some of its costs — Liberate Tate is selling very limited edition T-shirts, as well as prints by Conrad Atkinson.",https://hyperallergic.com/288254/liberate-tate-activists-look-back-on-six-years-of-fighting-bp-sponsorship/,,Hyperallergic
12,2019-02-05 00:00:00,2019,2.0,5,Ron Bousso,BP's 2018 profit doubles to five-year high as output soars,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP joined its competitors in posting a strong 2018 performance, with a doubling of profits driven by strong growth in oil and gas output following a large U.S. shale acquisition.      Record utilization of its oil and gas fields and refining capacity further helped BP seal what was a transformational year as the aftermath of the deadly 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster eased.  But while the London-listed firm’s revenue beat forecasts, debt rose and the pace of its share buyback scheme slowed in the last quarter after it paid the first and largest tranche of the $10.5 billion BHP acquisition.  BP shares rose more than 3.3 percent in early trade, hitting their highest since early December.   “We now have a powerful track record of safe and reliable performance, efficient execution and capital discipline. And we’re doing this while growing the business,” BP Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said in a statement on Tuesday.  Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil and Chevron all reported stronger-than-forecast earnings last week driven by higher production in U.S. shale basins where Oil Majors have invested billions in recent years.  The strong gains came despite a sharp drop in crude prices at the end of the year that wiped out most gains made in share prices throughout the year.  Uncertainty over the outlook for oil prices as well as concerns over global economic growth and sino-American trade tensions are likely to continue to weigh on the sector.  Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary told Reuters he expected Brent crude prices to hold around current levels of $60 a barrel in 2019, while demand was expected to rise by 1.3 to 1.4 million barrels per day, a similar pace to that seen in 2017.  Capital expenditure will be $15 to $17 billion this year, after reaching $15.1 billion in 2018, Gilvary said.  BP plans to sell $10 billion of assets over the next two years to help pay for the BHP deal, including a suite of fields in the United States as it focuses on the most attractive basins, he added.  After settling the vast majority of payments for the 2010 spill in the Gulf of Mexico, totaling nearly $70 billion, BP has more recently focused on growing production into the next decade, including the BHP deal which is its largest in 30 years.  For the year, BP’s profit rose to a five-year high of $12.7 billion, double the previous year’s $6.17 billion and above analyst expectations of $11.88 billion.  “Overall, we see this as a strong set of results, with stronger underlying earnings translating into cash,” Biraj Borkhataria, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note.   Graphic: BP annual results - tmsnrt.rs/2Bl1O05  Graphic: BP quarterly profits - tmsnrt.rs/2HNkHOO  Production rose to 3.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018 after BP completed the acquisition of BHP’s onshore U.S. shale portfolio and thanks to the start up of new fields including the 120,000 barrel per day Clair Ridge project in the North Sea.   Excluding its share of production from its 20 percent stake in Russia’s Rosneft, BP’s production was up 8.2 percent from 2017.  Gearing, the ratio between debt and BP’s market value, rose to 30.3 percent at the end of 2018 from 27.4 percent a year earlier. Net debt was $44.1 billion at the end of last year.

Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads STRATFORD-UPON-AVON, UK — On Saturday, a festival about freedom of protest at the Royal Shakespeare Company collided dramatically with real-life dissent. The theatrical activist group BP or not BP? staged an unauthorized “Fossil Free Mischief Festival” to coincide with the RSC’s own Mischief Festival. Throughout its renegade festival, BP or not BP? called on the RSC to stop accepting money from the oil company BP, which the group believes colludes with repressive governments around the world to silence protest, while contributing to climate change. Ten performances took place on the doorstep of the RSC’s theaters over the course of five hours on a busy Saturday afternoon. Over 70 protestors arrived dressed as Shakespearean characters, including Caliban, Juliet, and Hamlet, who formed a singing and dancing “Mischief Mob.” The protest featured live music, poetry, and a spoof wrestling match between clowns dressed as fossil fuels and renewable energy sources. Models in a drag fashion show — in which performers wore outfits inspired by solar panels and wind turbines — “lip-synced for their lives, and yours,” singing “Burn Baby Burn,” “Toxic,” and “The Tide is High.” A “Shakespearean Insult Booth” allowed visitors to dress up and get photographed holding signs with mix-and-match Bard-inspired epithets — from “BP, you … clay-witted puke stocking” to “BP, you … stony-hearted stewed prune.” The action culminated with performers entering the RSC theater’s foyer to sing protest songs adapted from Matilda the Musical (which was first produced by the RSC) around a board displaying the museum’s sponsors. Characters named BPRosencrantz and BPGuildenstern in large ruffs shaped like BP’s sun-like Helios logo were then marched symbolically out of the building. After darkness fell, guerrilla projectionists beamed phrases such as “BP also sponsors: repressive regimes” and “BP also sponsors: climate change” onto the theater’s exterior. The RSC did not intervene in the day’s unsanctioned protests. The RSC receives around £375,000 (~$496,000) per year from BP, making up just 0.6% of the theater’s annual income. This money sponsors the venue’s £5 ticket scheme for 16–25 year olds. BP or not BP? argues that, given the RSC’s £4 million (~$5.3 million) annual surplus, the scheme could easily be funded in-house. High-profile actors including Emma Thompson, Vanessa Redgrave, and Mark Rylance are supporting the ongoing Fossil Free £5 Tickets crowd-funding project. Rylance has spoken publicly about refusing to perform at the RSC until it drops BP’s sponsorship. “We’re delighted that the RSC is showcasing new, political plays about freedom of speech,” Sarah Horne, a member of BP or not BP?, told Hyperallergic. “The shows in the official Mischief Festival — Day of the Living and #WeAreArrested — tell vital stories of struggles against repression in Mexico and Turkey. But it is deeply upsetting to see these plays being used by BP to position itself as a champion of free speech while colluding with governments that silence people speaking out against the oil and gas industry around the world.” Fellow BP or not BP? performer Danny Chivers added: “The RSC want to appear open-minded and progressive, but how can they do this while taking BP’s money? Being branded with BP’s logo undercuts their values. We’ve heard from sources within the organization that there’s internal dissent on the topic, and that this is currently a live debate. It’s our job to add to that pressure.” Passersby on their way to the theater stopped to watch the action, which provoked responses ranging from supportive to unconvinced. One visitor told Hyperallergic: “It’s an interesting question. Is that money better off in the pockets of BP’s shareholders or used by the RSC? I’d prefer the latter, but it’s definitely a moral dilemma.” Another opined: “At least BP’s money is going somewhere good. It would be better if RSC chose another company, but is there any such thing as an ethical corporate sponsor?” A passing tourist defended the oil company, saying: “BP are trying to get better – when you compare what they were like 20 years to today, there’s no comparison … they’re even moving into solar energy. I think the theater should take the money if it’s there.” In recent years, many venues have signed up to the Oil Sponsorship Free commitment, including the Royal Court, Red Ladder and Arcola theaters. Oil Sponsorship Free argues that sponsorship gives companies the “social license to operate.” The group states: “The voices of respected artists and cultural institutions are co-opted to drown out the voices of those whose rights, health, family, and subsistence are endangered by oil drilling.” Pressure from activist groups in the Art Not Oil Coalition (such as Liberate Tate and Platform London) have led to BP’s sponsorship being dropped by both Tate and the Edinburgh Festival in 2016. It’s unknown whether the RSC will follow the lead of other arts organisations in the future, but for now the official line is clear. In a statement sent to Hyperallergic, an RSC spokesperson said: BP’s sponsorship of our £5 ticket scheme for 16–25 year olds gives many young people the chance to see our work. The scheme is highly valued by our audiences and helps us establish lifetime enthusiasts for Shakespeare and live theatre. Corporate sponsorship is an important part of our diverse funding mix, alongside ticket sales, public investment, private philanthropy and commercial activity. We have a clear donation and sponsorship acceptance policy, and consider potential offers of support individually. Importantly, no sponsor influences or drives our artistic decision making and we remain committed to exploring contemporary issues and ideas in all our work. Despite activists demanding “Out, damned logo!”, it seems as if the RSC dropping BP is not to be — for now.

Woodfibre said on Wednesday BP Gas Marketing Limited had agreed to buy 0.75 million tonnes per year (mtpa) of LNG for 15 years starting in 2023, when the project in British Columbia is expected to come onstream.  The facility’s capacity is expected to be 2.1 mtpa.  It said it was also working on an agreement “for BP Canada to provide gas transportation and balancing services ensuring a reliable delivery of gas to the Woodfibre LNG export facility over the 15-year term”.  Dozens of companies are planning LNG export terminals in North America to capitalize on gas made accessible from shale drilling technology. Signing up committed, long-term buyers is vital for financing and building such projects.  Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) approved its 14 mtpa project in Kitimat, northern British Columbia, in October, triggering a new cycle of projects to be built to meet an anticipated LNG shortage in mid-2020s.  But the LNG Canada project is the only one in Canada to have progressed to construction stage.   Woodfibre LNG is a subsidiary of Pacific Oil & Gas, part of the Singaporean conglomerate RGE. Pacific Oil & Gas operates two LNG import terminals in China, as well as other upstream and midstream oil and gas assets.  LNG produced on the west coast of Canada is likely to be sold in Asia which accounts for about 75 percent of global demand. There are at least half a dozen LNG export terminal projects planned in Canada, and more in the United States.

In its benchmark 2019 Statistical Review of World Energy, BP recalibrated some Saudi gas reserves as oil, allowing Riyadh to close in on Venezuela’s top spot as the world’s largest reserves holder.  BP said Saudi Arabia’s proved oil reserves were revised to 297.7 billion barrels at the end of 2018 from 266.2 billion a year earlier, only slightly behind 303 billion in Venezuela.   Canada was third with 168 billion barrels, followed by Iran with 156 billion and Iraq with 147 billion.  The increase came after Saudi Arabia started separate reporting of oil, gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) reserves, BP Chief Economist Spencer Dale told reporters.   NGLs were previously included in gas reserves, Dale said. As a result, these fell to 208.1 trillion cubic feet from 283.8 trillion cubic feet in 2017.  Saudi Arabia has become more open in reporting its reserves as it prepared to float its energy company Saudi Aramco. The listing was postponed and is now planned for early next decade.  Riyadh has rarely changed its oil reserves estimates in the past, despite pumping 8-10 million barrels per day.  The last big change in reserves happened in 1989, when they were raised without explanation from 170 billion barrels to 260 billion.  BP also said oil reserves for the United States, which became the world’s top producer in 2018, were revised upwards by 22% to 61.2 billion barrels from 50 billion barrels at the end of 2017.  Overall, global reserves were little changed at 1,729.7 billion barrels, roughly equivalent to 50 years of the world’s current demand.

16,2016-05-19 00:00:00,2016,5.0,19,Claire Voon,Greenpeace Activists Climb the British Museum to Protest BP Sponsorship,"Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads Today, the British Museum received a guerrilla re-branding from activists urging it to drop its sponsorship deal with BP, an agreement now in talks for possible renewal next year. In a striking display, 14 members of Greenpeace scaled the museum entryway’s massive columns, unfurling seven large banners to protest the museum’s current BP-sponsored exhibition, Sunken cities. The show, which opened to the public today, displays objects from the ancient Egyptian cities of Thonis-Heracleion and Canopus, submerged thousands of years ago due to shifts in climate; the irony here, of course, is that the sinking of cities remains a reality today, and BP’s business in oil and gas contributes to the occurrence of such disasters. Five of the banners spelled out the names of cities previously victim or vulnerable to flooding, including New Orleans, Manila, and Hebden Bridge, a British town that experienced devastating floods last December. The other two banners bookending them riffed on the exhibition’s name and funding source, reading, “Sinking cities” and “climate change supported by BP.” Greenpeace has also created an online petition calling for the museum to end its partnership with the oil giant. As of press time, it has received over 9,000 signatures. “The British Museum dedicates itself to learning, discovery, and the conservation of human cultures, but the only discoveries BP seeks are more fossil fuels to dig up and burn, which are already polluting our air and warming our world,” Greenpeace activists said in a statement. “We’re here today taking a stand because of the irony of an oil company sponsoring an exhibition whose name practically spells out impacts of climate change. What were they thinking?” Police led the protestors away when they descended, but the banners remained. The museum closed between 10am and 2pm UK time, but the decision “was taken to ensure the safety of the Museum’s visitors,” as a spokeswoman for the institution told Hyperallergic. This week is shaping up to be a particularly rocky one for the museum: the Greenpeace protest arrives just two days after art activist group BP or Not BP? carried out two interventions during the Sunken cities press and VIP openings. As Hyperallergic previously reported, demonstrators on Tuesday placed a large installation inside the museum and staged a performance to highlight not only the effects BP’s business has on climate change but also the company’s history of striking deals with Egypt’s repressive governments. BP or Not BP?’s Jess Worth confirmed that the Greenpeace action was “totally separate, though we are thrilled that Greenpeace has joined in the campaign, ratcheting the pressure up a good few more notches!” Hyperallergic reached out to the British museum for comment regarding the string of protests and received the following statement: The British Museum is exceptionally grateful to BP for their loyal and on-going support which has allowed the Museum to bring world cultures to a global audience through hugely popular exhibitions and their associated public programs. Discussions regarding the renewal of the partnership are continuing.",https://hyperallergic.com/300076/greenpeace-activists-climb-the-british-museum-to-protest-bp-sponsorship/,,Hyperallergic

The energy giant on Tuesday reported its full-year and fourth quarter results, saying profits cratered 51% last year from $12.1 billion (£8.4 billion) to $5.9 billion (£4.1 billion). When you drill down into the results it's even worse — fourth quarter profit was just $196 million (£136.1 million) compared with $2.2 billion (£1.5 billion) for the fourth quarter of 2014. That's a huge 91% drop, far worse than the 51% registered across the year. Things are trending downwards. The cause is clear — tanking oil prices. BP says in its statement: Despite strong operational performance and growing cost reductions, the lower underlying result was predominantly driven by the impact of steeply lower oil and gas prices on BP's Upstream segment, which reported a pre-tax loss for the quarter. The Brent crude oil marker price averaged $44 a barrel in 4Q 2015 compared with $77 a year earlier, and the average Henry Hub US gas marker price was $2.27 per million British thermal units compared with $4.04 in 4Q 2014. BP took a $2.6 billion (£1.8 billion) writedown on its upstream business — the part that actually drills oil out of the ground — in the fourth quarter alone. As a result of collapsing profits and prices, BP says it is cutting up to 4,000 jobs in its upstream business in 2016 and up to 3,000 in its downstream business — which processes and delivers energy — by the end of 2017. BP follows rival Shell in announcing sweeping job cuts. Shell announced a few weeks ago that it is cutting 10,000 jobs as a result of the collapsing oil price. BP's costs were cut by $3.4 billion (£2.3 billion) in 2016 and it is aiming for an addition $7 billion (£4.8 billion) in savings by 2017. As you might expect after such a downbeat update, shares are tanking.

The Association’s Ethics Committee announced today that it found no violations of its Code of Ethics from the provided evidence, which contained internal emails and memos from the British Museum, Science Museum, Tate, and National Portrait Gallery that Art Not Oil acquired through Freedom of Information Act requests. The Committee dismissed the report’s allegations that shared intel of anti-oil protests and BP’s influence on museum programming as well as on curatorial decision-making were suspect, describing these practices as “common practice” and “appropriate.” “None of the emails quoted in the report suggest anything other than polite correspondence and friendly working relationships,” the Committee wrote. “The inclusion of such correspondence in the Art Not Oil report was considered poorly judged.” Art Not Oil has published its own extensive response to the decision, noting that its members are grateful the Museums Association investigated their claims but that they are “disappointed that they have not taken a stronger line today.” The coalition’s own statement argues that any museum doing business with BP is backing and endorsing a major fossil fuel company it considers destructive to the climate crisis, and that the oil giant is no typical backer, thus requiring greater levels of scrutiny. “[The Committee members] start from the premise that their remit does not extend to commenting on BP’s business practices, and approach the report’s content disconnected from this essential context,” Art Not Oil writes. “They then describe much of the activity we uncovered as ‘standard practice’ for a relationship with a corporate sponsor. But BP is not just any sponsor — it is an extremely powerful international oil company with controversial operations, a multi-billion dollar turnover and a serious image problem. As a result, no interaction between BP and a cultural institution takes place in an ethical vacuum. “We would therefore question whether, in this case, ‘standard practice’ is best practice,” the statement continues. “We believe that the purpose of an ethical policy is to continually revise an organization’s practices in relation to a shifting global context. And that context is shifting fast.” The Museum Association’s decision follows a recent, major blow to Art Not Oil’s mission to end oil industry sponsorship of the arts: the renewal of BP’s five-year deals with the British Museum, London’s National Portrait Gallery, the Royal Shakespeare Company, and the Royal Opera House. But as the coalition urged in a statement issued last week, it will continue to challenge such partnerships as long as BP’s logo hangs in cultural spaces. Art Not Oil’s Chris Garrard told Hyperallergic that the Information Commissioner’s Office is also now investigating the coalition’s complaints over inconsistent responses to their FOI requests from BP-sponsored museums. “Alongside that, we are continuing to make further information requests in order to develop an even fuller picture of how BP uses it arts sponsorship to cleanse its image and push its agenda,” Garrard said.",https://hyperallergic.com/317953/uk-museum-ethics-committee-rejects-allegations-of-corruption-in-bps-sponsorships/,,Hyperallergic

20,2019-06-11 00:00:00,2019,6.0,11,Promit Mukherjee,"Reliance, BP to start work on third gas project in India's Bay of Bengal","MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s Reliance Industries Ltd and partner BP said on Tuesday they would start developing a third gas field off India’s east coast.  The Reliance and BP consortium, in which BP has a 30% stake, are already developing two gas blocks off India’s east coast.  The three projects, developing 3 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of discovered gas, would cost 350 billion rupees ($5 billion) to develop and could produce about 30 million standard cubic meters of gas per day (mscmd) phased over 2020-2022, Reliance said.  At peak production, the three fields together could meet up to 10% of India’s demand by 2022, analysts say.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi previously set a target to raise the share of gas in India’s energy mix to 15% by 2030 from below 6.5% now. Experts say the slow pace of development so far makes that target difficult to achieve.  “The gas will satiate the increasing demand for clean fuel in the country, save foreign exchange and reduce dependency on imported gas,” Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani said.  Reliance was the first company in India to start large-scale gas production from the Krishna-Godavari basin, also known as the KG Basin, in the Bay of Bengal, beginning in 2008-2009.  But output from its first project fell sharply within three years, starving gas-fired power plants of fuel and leaving them unable to service their bank loans taken out in 2007-2008.  The latest projects will mark Reliance’s return to exploration and production.  “We are building an important upstream business in India, helping to supply the country’s growing gas market,” BP Group Chief Executive Bob Dudley said in the statement.  India’s biggest oil and gas explorer, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd, is also developing reserves off India’s east coast. At peak production, also expected to be around 2022-2023, the company will produce 15 mscmd of gas.  Experts say India could produce up to 50 mscmd of gas, or almost one-third of India’s total gas demand, from the east coast.

The talks between Shell, the field’s operator, and BP failed due to disagreement over the value of the 27.5% stake, the sources said.  Industry sources estimated the stake was worth $250 million when Reuters first reported on the talks in April.  Shell holds a 28% stake in Shearwater, while Exxon Mobil has the remaining 44.5%.  Shell and BP declined to comment.  Ariel Flores, BP’s North Sea boss, told reporters in Aberdeen this week that the company wanted to focus on developing the Eastern Trough Area Project (ETAP) hub, located north of Shearwater.  “You can’t do it all in the central North Sea,” Flores said, when asked about BP’s thinking on Shearwater.  Shearwater, 225 km (140 miles) east of Aberdeen, was discovered in 1988 and first developed in 2000.  At peak production, the gas export capacity of the Shearwater hub is expected to be around 400 million standard cubic feet per day, or roughly 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, according to Shell.  Shell announced plans last year to expand a gas hub around Shearwater, including the construction of a new pipeline.

22,2017-02-09 18:18:00,2017,2.0,9,Rosemary Westwood,Mutated Fish Still Haunt Louisiana’s Fishermen After the BP Oil Spill," Robert Campo held out a sun-darkened, weathered hand in the shape of gun. ""If somebody had a gun to your head, and they said, 'You gotta catch one live oyster on this reef,' you'd have to say, 'Pull the trigger.'"" Campo, a fisherman and owner of Campo's Marina in Shell Beach, Louisiana, was describing some of the once-rich oyster reefs along the Gulf Coast that have been barren—""as clean as this floor""—ever since the 2010 BP oil spill. He said he's seen fish with deformities, too.  He'd just finished telling his story of the spill to a crowd of New Orleans residents and marine scientists who'd descended on the city for an international conference on oil spills this week. The event Monday evening represented an anomaly among the hundreds of research presentations, workshops and sessions during the Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill and Ecosystem Science Conference. As a collaboration with the Story Collider podcast series, it focused on the personal stories, not the science, of oil spills. Campo—the lone fisherman at the event that night—recalled the beautiful sunrise the morning of the spill, before he'd heard the news. Later, oil covered everything, birds and crabs with their bellies full of eggs. Fishermen were recruited to help stem the oil's advance toward the marshlands by installing floating booms. Campo considers himself a ""strong guy,"" and though he tried to hide his feelings from his crew as they fought the spill during the day, he'd go home at night, ""and it was killing me."" Charlie Henry told the crowd about getting that call in April 2010 in the middle of the night, one of 40 to 60 he receives in a year as the director of the Gulf of Mexico Disaster Response Center for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). He'd been chasing oil spills for 25 years by then. Each spill is an ""unplanned and uncontrolled scientific experiment,"" he said, one in which the goal is always ""minimal regret."" And while each call starts the same way, ""It had, even at that time, the feeling of something very big.""  The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig off the coast of Louisiana killed 11 people and pumped an estimated 3.19 million barrels of oil and gas into the Gulf of Mexico over 87 days. In just the first year, it cost Louisiana's seafood industry an estimated $94 million, at a minimum. Deemed the largest oil spill in US history, it also spurred what researchers call an unprecedented growth in oil spill research, at a rate four times that of other fields and to the tune of $1 billion, said Dave Westerholm, the director of NOAA's Office of Response and Restoration, during a keynote address to the conference.  In addition to overhauling its safety practices and procedures, BP launched a $500 million, 10-year research project, dubbed the Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative, as one of a dozen conference organizers. (Representatives of BP, as well as other oil companies, were at the conference.)    There is so much new research, in fact, that state and federal authorities tasked with planning, preparing and responding to oil spills told the conference they're struggling to keep up.  ""The magnitude of information is a bit overwhelming for responders,"" said John Caplis, an oil spill response expert at the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, a federal agency within the Department of the Interior.  That is partly the reason the conference exists: to give researchers, industry, governments and non-governmental organizations a chance to get up to speed (to the extent that's possible). But this year's conference had an added component—how to turn that abundance of science into practical strategies for oil spill response and coastline restoration. Researchers are still considering a multitude of questions. What are the impacts and behaviours of dispersants—chemicals used heavily during the BP spill to combat the oil? What's the best method to clean up sea surface oil slicks? How damaging are lost crab traps to efforts to restore seafloor ecosystems? What should be done about the growth of the red lionfish, an invasive fish species, in the Gulf after the BP spill?    In Louisiana—a state easily won by Donald Trump—it's an inauspicious time to be talking about protecting the environment and integrating scientific research into government policy. The new president campaigned in part on trashing the very idea of climate change, including musing that it could be a Chinese hoax. His first few weeks in office have been marred by controversy over efforts to curb communication between environmental and health departments in the public; removing a government web page about climate change; appointing Rick Perry, a climate skeptic, as energy secretary; and Scott Pruitt, an opponent to environmental regulations, to run the Environmental Protection Agency.  During a panel about government policy and oil spill research filled mostly with government officials, no one mentioned Trump.  Read More:   Watch the Advent of Deep Sea Mining Unfold With this Big Data Tool  ""These folks here are representing national agencies for the most part, and so they're going to have to be nuanced in what they say,"" said panelist Nancy Kinner, a leading oil spill response scientist and head of the Coastal Response Research Center at the University of New Hampshire (a carefully-chosen location for her research, since New Hampshire is not an oil-producing state).     She's still hopeful that this particular brand of research could be insulated from federal politics. Because regional planning for oil spills is informed by regional advisory committees, ""applying this research can be done at the local level,"" she said. Robert Campo is not a scientist, nor is he exactly trusting of them. His intimacy with the sea is a family legacy, inherited from 117 years of Campo fishermen. He has, he jokes, saltwater in his veins. But like researchers, he, too, continues to try to make sense of the spill and its impact on his community.  ""I saw a fish this summer, a menhaden, that still had spinal deformities. Speckled trout born with kinks in their spines. I've seen bottlenose dolphins with big blotches on them,"" Campo said.

23,2016-05-04 00:00:00,2016,5.0,4,Claire Voon,Internal Documents Show How BP Oiled the Wheels at UK Museums,"Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads After sharing a handful of emails detailing suspicious correspondence between British museums and their sponsor BP, the Art Not Oil Coalition has released the full set of documents it obtained, accompanied by a 40-page report describing the potentially unethical partnerships. The emails and memos, acquired through a series of Freedom of Information Act requests over an 18-month period, suggest multiple instances in which BP exerted control over museums’ curatorial decision making and took advantage of their resources and international networks to further the company agenda. The documents come largely from the British Museum, the National Portrait Gallery, the Science Museum, and Tate — which will terminate its BP sponsorship next year — but also under scrutiny are the Scottish National Portrait Gallery and the British government’s Department for Culture, Media, and Sport (DCMS). “Our report raises not just one or two questions but a whole series of concerns that need to be addressed by the various institutions,” Art Not Oil’s Chris Garrard, who primarily led and compiled the research, told Hyperallergic. “If they do not provide satisfactory explanations, it will seriously undermine the public’s trust in them.” Much of the information in the internal documents is redacted — and Garrard’s report also discusses difficulties in obtaining the material and how institutions may still be withholding information illicitly — but what remains hints that BP’s sponsorship deals do violate sections of the Museums Association’s code of ethics. The oil giant appears to have substantial sway over the cultural institutions, while providing just a small amount of funds to each one: its contributions in 2013 amount to less than 1% of that year’s total individual incomes for the British Museum, Royal Opera House, and Tate. According to Art Not Oil, the money the British Museum receives from BP is equivalent to the profit the company makes every two hours. BP’s apparent influence on exhibition content emerges in emails leading up to last year’s opening of a show it sponsored at the British Museum, Indigenous Australia: enduring civilisation. Some correspondence released last week shows that BP apparently had final word on the inclusion of a commissioned work by painters from the indigenous Australian Spinifex group. According to Art Not Oil, most of the Aboriginal communities consulted during the planning phase did not know of BP’s involvement, which overlapped with the company’s contentious fight to drill in the Great Australian Bight. The exhibition’s primary goal was also seemingly to “promote the ongoing partnership between the British Museum & BP,” as reads the first bullet point on a “Marketing objectives” slide in a presentation created by and for museum staff prior to the show. This intent is echoed in action notes from an Indigenous Australia meeting at BP’s London office last April; they recount that some of the art for the exhibition panels was to be sent to “[redacted] for BP brand approval.” In another email, a museum employee provided a thorough rundown of curator Gaye Sculthorpe’s academic and professional background to someone at BP, in order to show “why she is the perfect choice for curating this exhibition. “It was a very careful choice and I hope you will agree there could not be a better person with her background,” the email reads. In response to Art Not Oil’s claims, the British Museum reportedly told the coalition, “Corporate sponsors of the British Museum do not have any influence over the content of our exhibitions.” Many of the documents also relate to the anti–BP sponsorship protests the museums have witnessed in recent years — mostly organized by Art Not Oil’s affiliate groups BP or not BP? and Liberate Tate. They suggest that BP has not only repeatedly discussed protest activity with institution staff but also attempted to shape internal security protocol. The same action notes from the British Museum and BP’s April meeting, for instance, confirm the possibility of demonstrations during Indigenous Australia‘s run. BP or not BP? did stage an unsanctioned performance three weeks after the opening. The British Museum denied speaking with its corporate funder about such matters, telling Art Not Oil, “There are no records of any communications having taken place between the Museum and BP on potential actions.” Such sharing of protest information apparently occurred between BP and its other cultural partners as well: Emails to the Tate show that BP reached out the day before a 300-person company event at the museum last January to inquire if the institution “had any intel” related to “protest threat”; someone at the museum responded that “Suitable resources will be in place.” Last March, another concerned email from BP notified a Tate contact about Art Not Oil’s intention to create an oil spill on the gallery’s steps, linking directly to the Facebook event page; Art Not Oil’s report notes that that demonstration “had a significant and disproportionate police presence throughout.” The Science Museum, too, met with BP in September to discuss “recent protest activity at other museums and the potential for protest activity at the Science Museum during the launch event” of its BP-sponsored Cosmonauts exhibition. Most recently, a BP employee sent a tip to the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in February, alerting staff to a forthcoming action by a BP or not BP? branch to protest the gallery’s ties with the oil company. The shared documents also reveal that the oil giant attempted to standardize security policies at its partner institutions, anticipating a year of anti-BP rallies. In early February, the company sent an email flagged as highly important to a number of museums; it reads, “Dear all — we have had an indication that there will be increased activist action around the BP arts & culture programme in 2015,” and requests that security representatives from the cultural institutions meet with the BP security team. FOI request responses to Art Not Oil confirm that officers from the British Museum, National Portrait Gallery, Tate, and Science Museum Group attended the meeting at BP’s London office. Nine days later, museum personnel underwent a three-hour counterterrorism training session there, apparently necessary “in these times of heightened security,” as per a BP email. Titled “Project ARGUS,” it was coordinated by BP’s group security advisor, run by the National Counter Terrorism Security Office and Metropolitan Police Service, and described in a flyer as: [A] multimedia, interactive counter-terrorism tabletop exercise designed to put you and your business in the midst of a simulated terrorist attack. The exercise aims to increase awareness of counter terrorism issues and help make us more resilient as a community. Attendees will be faced with a series of questions and dilemmas to resolve, both individually and collectively. Personnel from Tate, the National Portrait Gallery, and the Science Museum were confirmed in attendance; the British Museum denied, in an email to Art Not Oil, that members of its security department attended any training or briefing sessions “hosted, led, or organized by BP between 2012 and 2015.” Art Not Oil argues that such coordinated efforts were attempts to limit protestors’ freedom of expression. What’s more, BP asked its partner institutions to look into their staff members’ possible affiliation with the trade union PCS, in an email linking to the union’s vote to condemn oil sponsorship of the arts. “I believe the PCS Union does represent some gallery employees,” a National Portrait Gallery staffer responded to BP in an email. “I have shared this information with a wider group of colleagues so that we can be prepared and ready for any potential impacts.” Besides potential collusion with museum employees on security procedures, BP appears to have cultivated close relationships with senior institution staff to maintain its influence. Emails show members of the oil company inviting Tate officials to a performance of Swan Lake at the Royal Opera House, former British Museum Director Neil MacGregor to Rigoletto, and National Portrait Gallery employees to the studio of a “leading British photographer.” The studio visit invitation was also extended to “the Boster Group BP team, and representatives of BP’s other cultural partners.” The Boster Group is an independent consultancy that aims to strengthen partnerships between corporations and cultural brands — or, in Art Not Oil’s words, “helps to sustain BP’s dominant position in the arts and culture sector.” A British Museum–prepared briefing document related to the Indigenous Australia exhibition further suggests the length to which the institution would go to protect its funder. A list of anticipated press inquiries shows that the museum helped BP deflect questions related to the company’s threats to the environment, from the broad — “Isn’t BP using arts sponsorship to soften up its image?” — to the highly specific — “Why does the BM continue to use BP as a sponsor? Surely it is unethical for an oil company to sponsor the arts? How do you justify taking money from an organization that has caused an environmental and social disaster of his magnitude?” Art Not Oil accuses BP of taking advantage of these alliances with museums for its own public relations strategies, at times using the spaces for ritzy VIP events to ingratiate itself to government officials from countries where it has business interests. Last October, the British Museum hosted a celebration of Mexico’s Day of the Dead, sponsored by the oil firm. BP had previously supported a similar festival in 2009, but plans for this one coincided with its vying for oil drilling leases in Mexico; in attendance were the ambassador of Mexico and members of the Mexican government. Another email reveals the museum’s events manager requesting that the Mexican Embassy delete the invitation list for the night “as soon as it is no longer required.” Funding for the event, the museum confirmed to Art Not Oil, came from BP in addition to what gives in its five-year sponsorship deal. “There is no doubt in anyone’s mind that the project is due to the whim of a funder, we have to deliver it, and that we don’t have a choice in the matter,” a British museum staff member reportedly told Art Not Oil, on condition of anonymity. Similarly, emails between BP and the Science Museum suggest the oil company was attempting to use the Cosmonauts exhibition to curry favor with officials in Russia, where BP has a 19.75% stake in the mostly state-owned oil company Rosneft. The correspondence shows BP employees attempting to push the show’s announcement date to late May instead of earlier in the month, as the museum would “struggle to engage senior officials then, and the following week our senior Russia team are not in the country,” one message reads. The museum announced the show on May 21, although an email does state that the determining factor was cosmonaut Alexey Leonov agreeing to speak at the press launch that day. Art Not Oil intends to formally submit its report and relevant documents to the Museums Association’s Ethics Committee, which will investigate the claims and determine whether the museums have breached its ethics code. Hyperallergic has reached out to the Museums Association about possible implications but has not received a response. This year, BP’s five-year sponsorship deals with the British Museum, the National Portrait Gallery, the Royal Opera House, and Tate will expire. The former three are still negotiating the possibility of future partnerships with BP. The deals, all renewed in December 2011, were seen by many at the time as BP’s solution to help clean up its reputation after the devastating Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010. BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley has stated that his company’s partnerships have “no strings attached,” but these released documents suggest that the public’s longtime concerns are founded, while breeding further and even more worrying ones.",https://hyperallergic.com/295638/internal-documents-show-how-bp-oiled-the-wheels-at-uk-museums/,,Hyperallergic

Guests were forced to climb over the wall with the assistance of security in order to enter the gallery. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads LONDON — On Monday, June 10, a group of activists staged a protest outside the National Portrait Gallery (NPG), disrupting the BP Portrait Awards awards ceremony and continuing calls for the gallery to end its sponsorship deal with the oil company, British Petroleum (BP). During the protest, the activists, artists, and performers blocked entry to the gallery for guests of the ceremony, linking arms in the doorways and chaining themselves to the gallery gates. They also handed out fake awards programs and painted live portraits of BP executives, as well as climate campaigners from West Papua, Mexico, Samoa, and the US Gulf Coast. Guests were forced to climb over the wall with the assistance of security in order to enter the gallery. The protest was organized by BP or Not BP?, an activist group which has staged more than 50 rebel performances at BP-sponsored arts institutions, such as The British Museum. The creative action group is part of the Art Not Oil Coalition, which includes other activist groups like Liberate Tate and Culture Unstained. In an email to Hyperallergic, a member of BP or Not BP?, Sarah Horne, said: The climate crisis is unfolding at terrifying speed. Those who have done least to cause the problem are worst hit, while oil companies like BP continue to rake in massive profits while actively making the problem worse. BP spends tens of millions every year lobbying against climate action and blocking clean energy alternatives, while pushing for access to yet more oil and gas that we cannot afford to burn. The National Portrait Gallery needs to stop giving this destructive and irresponsible company a veneer of respectability it does not deserve. The protest came days after artist Gary Hume, who is one of this year’s judges, published an open letter urging the gallery’s director, Nicholas Cullinan, to stop “hosting an oil-branded art prize.” This year’s winner of the portrait award was Charlie Schaffer. In a separate letter to Cullinan published yesterday, eight artists who have been involved with the award in the past, including Paul Benney, Henry Christian-Slane, Raoul Martinez, and Darvish Fakhr, added their voices to calls for the gallery to sever its ties. “We write to you as former winners, shortlisted artists and exhibitors in the BP Portrait Award,” the artists’ letter begins. “The refusal of the Sackler Trust grant demonstrated that the Gallery is indeed prepared to reject funding when a donor does not share its values. We urge you to apply this ethical rigor to your relationship with BP, and recognize it is a partnership that can no longer be defended.” Earlier this year, the gallery turned down a £1 million (~$1.27 million) grant from The Sackler Trust, because of its links with the opioid crisis in the US. This is not the first time that the BP-sponsored prize, which is “aimed at encouraging artists to focus upon and develop portraiture in their work”, has garnered criticism. In 2017, the winner Henry Christian-Slane donated £1,000 (~$1,269) of his prize money to anti-BP protests. The same year, Culture Unstained issued a formal call to the National Portrait Gallery to end its BP sponsorship, saying it violated the gallery’s own ethics policies. The gallery’s 2015 Ethical Fundraising Policy states that “we have a responsibility to ensure donations are not accepted from questionable or inappropriate sources”, including those which are “in conflict with the objectives and values of the gallery.” It is possible that next year’s BP sponsorship will be referred to the ethics committee for appraisal by the gallery’s trustees. The NPG responded to the criticism, saying in a statement that it “respects other people’s rights to express their views.” In an email to Hyperallergic, a spokesperson for the gallery said: The sponsorship of the Portrait Award by BP is now in its 30th year. This support directly encourages the work of talented artists and helps gain wider recognition for them and enables free admission for the public, over 275,000 visitors in London last year. Since 2010 BP has also given special support to the BP Portrait Award: Next Generation program which encourages 14 to 21 year olds to become involved in painted portraiture. A spokesperson for BP said the company was disappointed that artists had voiced their concerns about its support of creative endeavors. In a statement emailed to Hyperallergic they said: As for BP’s role in the energy transition, our position is clear. We support the Paris agreement and are taking action to advance the world’s transition to a low-carbon future. We’re reducing emissions from our own operations, down 1.7m tonnes last year, improving our products to support our customers’ efforts to reduce their emissions and creating new low-carbon businesses.

26,2019-06-09 00:00:00,2019,6.0,9,,Greenpeace activists halt BP's North Sea oil rig,"(Reuters) - Greenpeace activists said on Sunday they halted the progress of an oil rig destined for BP Plc’s North Sea exploration program off the coast of Scotland.  The activists demanded that one of the world’s biggest energy companies immediately end drilling new wells and invest only in renewable energy or shut its operations and return cash to investors.   Greenpeace said in a statement that a team of activists in boats drew up besides the 27,000-tonne rig as it was trying to leave Cromarty Firth.   The statement quoted a Greenpeace activist from Scotland it identified as Jo as saying: “This rig and the 30 million barrels it seeks to drill, are a sure a sign that BP are committed to business as usual, fueling a climate emergency that threatens millions of lives and the future of the living world.”  BP said in a statement: “While we recognize the right for peaceful protest, the actions of this group are irresponsible and may put themselves and others unnecessarily at risk.”   The company said it was working with Transocean Ltd, the rig’s owner and operator, and other authorities to resolve the situation.  BP added that it shared the protesters’ concerns about climate and that it supported the Paris climate agreement.   Responding to BP’s statement, Greenpeace said that while the rig was owned by Transocean, it was on its way to the Vorlich field to drill new oil wells operated by BP.  Last month, Greenpeace activists blocked BP’s London headquarters in St James’ Square in central London, demanding the company end its oil exploration.

As the impacts of climate change become increasingly apparent, the Gallery will look more and more out of step by hosting an oil-branded art prize.” Hume took his position public over the weekend; the award’s winner is due to be announced later today. On Sunday, he told the BBC that he was inspired to voice his opinion after the recent Extinction Rebellion climate change protests. (In April, Hyperallergic reported about the group’s staged die-ins at institutions like the Tate Modern and London’s Natural History Museum.) Culture Unstained is a nonprofit devoted to research, engagement, and campaigning against fossil fuel sponsorship in the cultural sector. For years, the organization has lobbied museums like the Science Museum and British Museum to end oil sponsorship, pointing a finger specifically at BP’s outsized influence over cultural institutions in the United Kingdom. They have also published research mapping influence between the oil company, Russia, and human rights abuses abroad. The group is also part of the Art Not Oil coalition, which includes other activist groups like Liberate Tate and BP or Not BP? Jess Worth, a co-director with Culture Unstained, says that Hume got in contact with her organization through Extinction Rebellion, and decided to publish his letter with them after a meeting. The idea for an artists’ letter came from a student who thought she could persuade a few people to sign onto the cause. Worth then fielded the idea with Raoul Martinez, who has previously spoken about issues with BP sponsorship, who recruited the seven other signatories. “We write to you as former winners, shortlisted artists and exhibitors in the BP Portrait Award,” begins the artists’ letter. “The refusal of the Sackler Trust grant demonstrated that the Gallery is indeed prepared to reject funding when a donor does not share its values. We urge you to apply this ethical rigor to your relationship with BP, and recognize it is a partnership that can no longer be defended.” They continue: With arts funding in decline, growing numbers of artists have little choice over which opportunities to accept or reject, and as the leading competition in its field, the Gallery’s annual award provides an unparalleled platform. That we must be prepared to associate our work with BP, providing a veneer of respectability to one of the world’s worst polluters and drivers of environmental destruction simply to participate, is deeply unfair. Aside from Martinez, the letter is signed by Paul Benney, Henry Christian-Slane, Alan Coulson, David Eichenberg, Darvish Fakhr, Wim Heldens, and Craig Wylie. The National Portrait Gallery has responded to the criticism, saying in a statement that it “respects other people’s rights to express their views.” A spokesperson continued in an email to Hyperallergic: The sponsorship of the Portrait Award by BP is now in its 30th year.

The 40,000 tonne Paul Loyd JNR left Cromarty Firth, north of Inverness, Scotland last Friday, after being held for six days by activists who had climbed and camped out on one of its legs.  Once at sea, the rig and its support vessels were forced to turn away three times after Greenpeace’s Arctic Sunrise ship prevented it from reaching the Vorlich oilfield to start its drilling campaign.  The rig finally reached its destination on Wednesday afternoon, Greenpeace said. According to the ship tracking website www.marinetraffic.com, the vessel was anchored.   “Each day we’ve held BP off is a day we’ve prevented them further fueling the climate emergency,” said Sarah North, a Greenpeace climate campaigner.  BP did not reply to a request for comment.  BP announced last year plans to invest 200 million pounds ($251.16 million) to develop the Vorlich field in the central North Sea which holds some 30 million barrels of oil and gas equivalent.  It is expected to start production in 2020 with an output of 20,000 barrels per day, according to BP’s website.

In addition, the company will finish paying the $1 billion it's pledged in early restoration projects and cough up another $ 1 billion-plus to settle false claims, reimburse the US government and the states for their costs responding to the spill, and pay royalties on the oil lost in the disaster, as well as setting aside money for yet-undiscovered damages.

Related: Alabama Taps BP Spill Funds for Another Upscale Beach Project US District Judge Carl Barbier signed off on the $20.8 billion settlement Monday afternoon in New Orleans, bringing BP's running tab for the disaster to around $55 billion. In a brief statement, company spokesman Geoff Morrell said the company was ""pleased"" that the settlement was complete. When the settlement was proposed last fall, many observers were angered by the fact that BP could write off the bulk of the payments on its taxes. Federal law prevents the company from taking a tax deduction for the $5.5 billion in Clean Water Act penalties, but it can claim the rest on its returns, according the settlement. Nearly 99 percent of the 29,000 people that wrote to the Justice Department about the proposed settlement complained about that fact during the public comment period. But the government said that while the law only bars the company from claiming its fines as a business expense, a ""relevant tax authority"" will have the final say on whether other payouts can be deducted. ""This is the consistent process taken in all similar consent decrees,"" it said. ""And it should be noted that had this case been litigated instead of settled, the outcome concerning tax liability would have been the same."" The April 20, 2010, blowout off Louisiana sank the drill rig Deepwater Horizon and killed 11 workers aboard. The undersea gusher it uncorked spewed crude into the Gulf for nearly three months before it was capped. Tar balls and larger chunks of weathered oil are still washing up on beaches in the northern Gulf, and the federal government linked the spill to the deaths of large numbers of dolphins, tens of thousands of birds and turtles, and billions of oysters, one of the Gulf states' biggest products.

Trump named Clark on Wednesday to be Assistant Attorney General for environment at the Department of Justice, representing the U.S. government on environmental regulation and enforcement issues.  Clark, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis, represented BP after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion and Macondo oil well rupture that killed 11 workers and caused the largest offshore environmental disaster in U.S. history.  The accident polluted large parts of the Gulf, killing marine wildlife and harming businesses.  Along the U.S. Gulf coast, local communities are still grappling with cleanup and restoration, and had relied on the federal government and EPA to protect them against climate change and oil and gas company accidents, said Cynthia Sarthou, director of the Gulf Restoration Network in Louisiana.  “I think the enforcement of any pollution laws is going to be at risk right now,” Sarthou said. “Bossert (Clark) is unlikely to hold the oil and gas industry accountable for pollution.”  Sarthou added that most of the oil and gas infrastructure along the U.S. Gulf coast is aging, putting local environmental groups on alert for future accidents.  “While this administration continues to choose profits over people, South Louisiana residents continue to struggle to recover from the economic, health and environmental impacts of the BP oil drilling disaster,” said Colette Pichon Battle, of the Human Rights Network, a lawyer who represented local communities affected by the BP accident.  According to a White House statement, Clark is a “complex trial and appellate litigator with especially deep experience in administrative law.”   In addition to practicing law in private practice, he also served worked as deputy assistant attorney general for environment at the Justice department from 2001 to 2005.  As an attorney, Clark also represented industry groups in several challenges against the previous administration’s Environmental Protection Agency.  This includes a lawsuit to revoke the “endangerment finding,” the scientific finding that gives the agency authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and one to challenge California’s ability to set its own stringent greenhouse gas emission standards for vehicles.

BP’s Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary dismissed the report as “a complete urban myth” on Tuesday. But the company’s press office declined to issue an outright denial, and close Russia-watchers called the notion at least plausible, especially in light of the recent poisoning claims about former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal, who was dosed with a rare chemical agent in England earlier this spring.  “While observers have no way to know for certain, Putin’s Russia has lost the benefit of the doubt,” John Sipher, a former CIA officer who worked in Moscow, told VICE News.   Dudley was forced to flee Moscow after blood test results showed he was being poisoned slowly, Ilya Zaslavskiy, who worked for TNK-BP for over four years, told UK newspaper the Telegraph late Monday. Zaslavskiy claimed that Russian authorities wanted to oust Dudley, so they began slipping him doses that weren’t sufficient to actually kill him.

Zaslavskiy claimed that Russian authorities wanted to oust Dudley, so they began slipping him doses that weren’t sufficient to actually kill him.  “One reason conspiracy theories are so popular in Russia is that conspiracies do, in fact, exist in Russia.”  The alleged incident took place two years after the death of Alexander Litvinenko, a former Russian intelligence officer who was killed in London after being exposed to radioactive polonium-210.   BP was locked in a dispute with its Russian shareholders in its joint-venture TNK-BP around this period. A couple months later, BP reached a truce in the feud with the Russian shareholders in which Dudley agreed to step down from his role as CEO of TNK-BP. He submitted his resignation on Dec. 1, 2008.   In 2013, TNK-BP was acquired by Russian state-controlled oil giant Rosneft.   In 2014, in a profile of TNK-BP shareholder Len Blavatnik, The New Yorker detailed the levels of harassment Dudley experienced before stepping away.   “According to a U.S. Embassy cable released by WikiLeaks, TNK-BP’s C.E.O., Robert Dudley, sometimes came home at night and found papers on his kitchen table: legal summonses compelling him to appear at hearings far from Moscow, with only a few hours’ notice,” The New Yorker wrote. “Fearing that his office was bugged, Dudley passed notes with his colleagues to avoid being overheard. He began feeling ill. On a trip out of Russia, according to three people close to BP, he had his blood tested, and poison was found in his bloodstream. He stopped eating food provided by the company and began to feel better. Finally, one day in July, Dudley learned that the police were coming for him the next morning. He went out the back door of his apartment to a waiting car and left the country.”  A spokesperson for BP declined to comment Tuesday on the story to VICE News.   “These rumours have been around for some time and we have not commented, and I’m afraid we do not intend to comment now,” BP spokesman Chris Reynolds wrote in an email.   Dudley himself has chafed at the dogged rumors. When asked about the poisoning report in 2014, he said: “I don’t know why people write that kind of thing. There was obviously a conflict there and I needed to leave or I wasn’t going to be in — in legal with my work permits and my residency status. And so I did have to leave and worked to manage the company from outside of Russia. But I don’t know. There’s a lot of wild things said about that period.”  Russia-watchers called the allegations plausible, if far from proven.   “One reason conspiracy theories are so popular in Russia is that conspiracies do, in fact, exist in Russia,” said Olga Oliker, director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC. “The Skripal poisoning, especially, makes things appear plausible that would probably have been dismissed a few months ago.”  Mark Galeotti, an expert on Russian intelligence, said the case appears far from conclusive — and that even if Dudley was poisoned, it might not have been the work of Russian spies.  “Many of the accusations of actual and attempted Russia-related murders we've heard of late, if true, are more likely to reflect the nature of modern Russian business, red in tooth and claw, rather than necessarily have anything to do with the Kremlin,” he wrote in an email to VICE News. “There still is a disturbing willingness among some in Russian business to use tactics like blackmail, forgery and even murder.”  BP’s co-investors in TNK-BP went on to feature in the notorious dossier compiled by former UK intelligence officer Christopher Steele.

Solar power contributes just over 1% of Brazil’s total electricity generation, which is expected to soar in the coming decades.  “These are the building blocks of which we will grow a very successful solar business across Brazil,” Lightsource BP Chief Operating Officer Kareen Boutonnat said in a statement.  Lightsource will target mainly corporate and industrial  buyers in both the regulated and unregulated market, according to Vlasios Souflis, director for international business development.  The Brazilian government last week awarded licenses for new power generation projects that would add 402 megawatts (MW) of capacity by 2023 at record-low price for solar generation. Enerlife was awarded over 160 megawatt in five solar projects.  Lightsource BP is the largest European utility solar developer with over $3 billion invested across nearly 2 gigawatt of solar projects around the world, according to Lightsource BP’s statement.  The company has in recent years expanded its operations in the U.S. states of California, Pennsylvania and Maryland as well as in Egypt and India.  The Enerlife portfolio consists of 1.9 gigawatts of solar projects, including of 440 megawatt in late stage development as well as 180 megawatt of distributed generation projects across five states, each one up to 5 megawatt capacity, Lightsource BP said.

Both BP and Tate were quick to deny that the decision was taken due to pressure from Liberate Tate, Platform London, and other artist collectives and organizations that have raised awareness of and opposition to the sponsorship. “They are free to express their points of view but our decision wasn’t influenced by that,” a BP spokesperson told the Independent. “It was a business decision.” But members of Liberate Tate see the decision as a victory and proof that protests, performance art actions, and public outcry can help spur changes at museums. “Their feeling that they needed to say that it’s not a response to the protests makes it clear that it is about that,” Mel Evans, a member of Liberate Tate and author of Artwash: Big Oil and the Arts, told Hyperallergic. “We had a lot of plans for this year because we kew it was a crucial time. We knew the renewal was going to be discussed at a board meeting in July, but we didn’t know the decision would come so soon.” BP has sponsored various exhibitions and programs at Tate since 1990, and its former chief executive, John Browne, has been the chairman of Tate’s board of trustees since 2009. Last year an information tribunal forced Tate to disclose the sums it had received from the energy giant (whose profits in 2015 totaled $6.48 billion). The figures were surprisingly low, ranging from £150,000 to £330,000 (~$225,800–497,550) annually, for a total of £3.8 million (~$5.7 million) between 1990 and 2006. For the 2006–07 fiscal year, money received from BP accounted for just 0.437% of Tate’s total income. While BP’s support of Tate may have come under the most public scrutiny to date, it’s not the only cultural sponsorship undertaken by the company. In London it also sponsors the British Museum, the National Portrait Gallery and its BP Portrait Award, and the Royal Opera House. “We hope that this decision by Tate, which is so influential, puts pressure on other museums and cultural groups to cut their ties with BP and the fossil fuel industry,” Evans said. “It really shows the power of grassroots groups and artist coalitions to make this kind of change. Six years ago this outcome seemed impossible.” Contacted for comment, a Tate spokesperson sent Hyperallergic the following statement regarding the split from BP: BP has decided it will not be renewing its sponsorship of the displays and other activities at Tate in 2017. The BP/Tate partnership has been an outstanding example of patronage and collaboration over nearly thirty years. It represents one of the most significant long-term corporate investments in UK arts and culture. Tate wishes to express its gratitude to BP for its longstanding commitment and ground-breaking support of the Collection displays and other programmes.",https://hyperallergic.com/282653/bp-will-cease-controversial-tate-sponsorship/,,Hyperallergic
37,2019-06-10 00:00:00,2019,6.0,10,Andrew Chung,U.S. Supreme Court to hear BP unit's dispute over Montana Superfund site,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to a hear a bid by a unit of British oil major BP Plc to avoid a lawsuit by private landowners in Montana seeking to force the company to pay for a more extensive cleanup of a Superfund hazardous waste site than what federal environmental officials had ordered.   The justices took up Atlantic Richfield Co’s appeal of a lower court ruling allowing a lawsuit by a group of property owners within the sprawling site of its former Anaconda copper smelter in western Montana to proceed to trial. Atlantic Richfield already has spent $470 million on soil and ground water restoration at the site ordered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.   The company, which is backed by industry groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers in the case, has said the lower court’s decision could lead to thousands more lawsuits nationwide against companies and further complicate federally mandated improvements to contaminated land.   The Superfund program, started in 1980, is intended to identify contaminated sites and ensure that those responsible for the pollution pay for the hazardous waste cleanup. It has been criticized over the years for slow efforts.   The Anaconda smelter, near the small community of Opportunity, Montana, operated between 1884 and 1980 and provided much of the world’s copper supply. It was designated a Superfund site in 1983 to reduce arsenic contamination in residential yards, pastures and ground water.   The landowners sued in state court to restore their properties to pre-smelter conditions. Atlantic Richfield said such state law claims were barred by the EPA’s actions under the 1980 Superfund law, called the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act.   The company also said the suit was prohibited under the U.S. Constitution’s so-called Supremacy Clause, which holds that federal law generally trumps state law.  In 2017, the Montana Supreme Court, the state’s highest court, ruled against Atlantic Richfield, allowing the case to move forward. Appealing to the Supreme Court, Atlantic Richfield said that decision could undermine the already-complex Superfund regime and leave companies open to thousands more lawsuits. It also could be forced to redo its work at the Anaconda site, the company said.  “This is the very definition of madness,” the company said in a legal brief.   President Donald Trump’s administration has said the Montana court improperly ruled in favor of the landowners but agreed that the case should proceed to trial before the justices hear it.   Also on Monday, the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal by Canada’s Teck Resources Ltd of a lower federal court’s decision holding the company liable under the Superfund law for pollution that settled in Washington state from a smelter in British Columbia. The company said the law cannot be applied outside U.S. borders.

38,2019-02-14 00:00:00,2019,2.0,14,Ron Bousso,"As renewables soar, BP sees China hitting brakes on energy growth","LONDON (Reuters) - Global demand for renewable power will soar at an unprecedented pace over the coming decades, BP said in a benchmark report on Thursday, while China’s energy growth is seen sharply decelerating as its economic expansion slows.  Still, China is set to remain the largest energy consumer by a long stretch into 2040 although India should overtake it in terms of demand growth beginning in the next decade, the British oil and gas giant said in its 2019 Energy Outlook.  China’s energy demand rose by 5.9 percent over the past 20 years, but is set to grow by only 1 percent by 2040 as its economy shifts from energy-intensive industries to services and as Beijing introduces stricter rules on air pollution.  BP revised down its forecast of China’s energy demand by 7 percent from last year’s report, “reflecting the pace at which China is adjusting to a more sustainable pattern of economic growth”.  Under BP’s base-case Evolving Transition scenario, global energy demand will increase by around one third by 2040, driven by rapidly expanding middle classes in Asia.   Renewables are expected to be the fastest-growing energy source with an annual gain of 7.1 percent, accounting for half the growth in global energy. Their share in primary energy is seen rising from 4 percent today to around 15 percent by 2040.  Compared with the level in last year’s report, BP raised by 9 percent its 2040 forecast of demand for renewable power such as solar and wind.  Renewables and natural gas, the least-polluting fossil fuel, will account for 85 percent of the growth in energy demand.  “Renewables will penetrate the energy system quicker than any other fuel ever,” BP Chief Economist Spencer Dale told reporters before the release of the report.  Solar power will increase by a factor of 10 by 2040 and wind by a factor of five under BP’s basic scenario.  While the share of oil in world energy demand rose from 1 percent to 10 over 45 years in the early 20th century, renewables are set to reach the same share over 25 years, Dale said.  In a world struggling to tackle climate change by curbing greenhouse gas emissions and to bring billions of people out of poverty, demand for electricity is set to account for around three quarters of the growth in energy.  Global energy-related carbon emissions hit a historic high of 32.5 gigatons in 2017, after being flat for three years, due to increased energy demand and the slowing of energy efficiency improvements, the International Energy Agency said last year.   The unprecedented growth in renewables is, however, not sufficient to meet U.N.-backed targets set under the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement to curb carbon emissions in order to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, he added.  Under the Evolving Transition scenario, carbon emissions will grow by 10 percent by 2040, much faster than in the past.  BP expects oil demand to plateau at around 108 million barrels per day (bpd) by the mid-2030s, amid growth in electric vehicles and higher engine efficiency.  Transportation continues to be the main driver of growth in oil consumption, with its share remaining stable at around 55 percent by 2040.  Demand for transport services will almost double by 2040, but gains of nearly 50 percent in engine efficiency for cars and trucks mean energy consumed by the sector should grow by only 20 percent.  Oil used to produce plastics is the largest source of demand growth over the period, increasing by 7 million bpd to 22 million bpd.  The growth in oil supply will initially come from rapidly expanding U.S. shale production, which BP expects will grow by 6 million bpd over the next 10 years, peaking at 10.5 million bpd in the late 2020s.  As U.S. shale output declines, production from members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will take the lead.  BP warned that an escalation in trade disputes could significantly reduce energy demand due to slowing economic growth. A 6 percent reduction in global gross domestic product in the period to 2040 versus BP’s base-case scenario would lead to a 4 percent decline in energy demand, it said.   Lower demand and slowing energy trade flows would have the biggest impact on oil and gas exporting countries such as Russia and the United States, BP said.

On Thursday night police removed and arrested two Greenpeace activists who had spent over 70 hours blocking the rig from leaving Cromarty Firth, north of Inverness, Scotland, Greenpeace said in a statement.   “We can’t give up and let oil giants carry on with business as usual because that means giving up on a habitable planet and our kids’ future,” said Greenpeace UK’s executive director, John Sauven.  Two more Greenpeace activists climbed up a leg of the rig in the early hours of Friday, the group said, adding it is organizing shifts for its climbers in its effort to prevent BP from drilling its Vorlich field.  Police have arrested nine people in connection with the protest, Scottish police said, adding they were working with the operators of the rig to reach a “safe resolution to the continuing protest”.      BP said in a statement it was coordinating with rig-owner Transocean and Scottish police.   “BP supports debate, discussion and peaceful demonstration, but the irresponsible actions of this group are putting themselves and others unnecessarily at risk, while ignoring court orders and police action,” the company said.  The Vorlich field, a relatively small development thought to contain 30 million barrels of oil, is due to come onstream in 2020. BP is working on the project together with Ithaca Energy, a unit of Israel’s Delek Group poised for a stock market listing.

The four-year exploration plan approved by the national hydrocarbons commission (CNH) covers a 700,000 square kilometer shallow water block, located north of the coast of Tabasco state.  BP won the rights to drill last June, along with its partner French oil major Total.   BP’s contract is one of over 100 awarded since a sweeping energy reform was finalized in 2014, championed by Mexico’s previous government in a bid to reverse years of declining crude production. The current government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has suspended all future auctions, favoring instead a larger role for national oil company Petroleos Mexicanos, known as Pemex.

The move represents a big bet by BP on U.S. oil and gas production at a time when energy prices are rebounding. It would allow it to significantly rebalance its business with oil production, after focusing largely on natural gas assets.   BP is the front-runner in the auction for the assets run by BHP, and could reach a deal in coming weeks, the sources added, cautioning that an agreement is not certain and it is possible that negotiations could end unsuccessfully.  The exact terms and composition of BP’s offer could not be learned. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. BP and BHP did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  BHP said in August it aimed to sell onshore shale assets in the Eagle Ford, Permian, Haynesville and Fayetteville basins, which it acquired at the height of the oil boom. It had come under pressure from activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp to do so.  The acreage for sale includes holdings that BHP acquired in its $12-billion takeover of Petrohawk Energy in 2011, which have declined rapidly in value as the price of natural gas has fallen from $4.50 at the time of the deal to a low of $1.60 last year.   In 2015, BP began operating its onshore U.S. business as a separate entity to make it more competitive. Since then, BP has expanded the business to include acreage in the Haynesville and Bossier shale plays near the Texas–Louisiana border.   However, BP’s expansion in U.S. shale fell behind many of it peers. When others were building out their presence onshore, BP’s focus was on the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil-spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, which has forced it to pay tens of billions of dollars in damages and restitution since 2010.  If completed, the acquisition of BHP’s acreage would be transformational for BP’s unit, adding oil-rich wells in the Permian and Eagle Ford basins of Texas.  Other oil majors that participated in the auction for the assets include Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N), sources have said.

43,2018-11-04 14:41:11,2018,11.0,4,David Roberts,Midterm elections 2018: Koch Industries and BP are trying to kill state climate initiatives,"The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) makes it vividly clear that averting catastrophic climate change means rapidly reducing the use of fossil fuels, getting as close to zero as possible, as soon as practicably possible. The US needs to fully decarbonize by mid-century or shortly thereafter. Big Oil, at least with its public face, has acknowledged that reality and is supporting a revenue-neutral carbon tax in the US (one that, not incidentally, would shelter the industry from legal threats based on climate change). It is attempting to act, or at least to be seen as acting, as a reasonable partner in the federal climate effort. Down at the state level, where media pays less attention? Not so much. Take what’s happening in Washington and Colorado. In those states, citizens who are tired of waiting for their elected officials to act are resorting to direct democracy: with ballot initiatives, up for votes on November 6, that would directly take on fossil fuels. (Washington’s would put a price on carbon emissions; Colorado’s would radically reduce oil and gas drilling.) According to their public records, in just those two states, just this year, oil and gas — both directly and through PACs — has dumped $47 million into efforts to crush the initiatives. That number could easily top $50 million by the time of the election. On two underdog state initiatives! Climate hawks often debate whether it works to frame Big Oil as the villain in the climate fight. But it’s not really a “messaging” question here. In these state fights over fossil fuels, Big Oil is playing the villain in a very non-metaphorical, non-symbolic way, in the form of spending outrageous amounts of money to fight off climate action. These initiatives illustrate, if it wasn’t already obvious, that state-by-state climate policy is going to be an uphill battle. In each state, support for the climate side comes from underfunded citizen and public-interest groups — and for the most part, only the ones inside the state. Meanwhile, Big Oil, backed by ideologically aligned billionaires like the Koch brothers, has effectively unlimited funds to spend on every one of these fights. It’s overwhelmingly asymmetrical. Let’s take a quick look at each one. I-1631, the initiative on Washington’s ballot this year, would charge a fee for carbon pollution (“fee” is not just a clever euphemism for tax; it’s actually a fee under state law). It would start at $15 per ton in 2020 and rise $2 a year (plus inflation) until 2035, where it would reach around $55. If state carbon targets are being reached, it would stay there; if not, it would continue upward. In my home state, climate change is on the ballot. Here’s why I’m voting @Yeson1631 and why I’m encouraging my fellow Washingtonians to do the same. https://t.co/JdjctyHaDG That is a comparatively mild carbon price compared to, say, what Canada just implemented nation-wide, or even what oil companies are supporting at the federal level. The revenue would be spent on clean energy, water, and forestry projects across the state, with around 30 percent of the investment targeted toward the most vulnerable communities. (You can read a longer piece I did on 1631 if you want the details.) Your ballots just arrived. If you live in Washington State, join us in voting #YesOn1631. Read #StoneGossard’s letter on why #PearlJam supports 1-1631: https://t.co/pKZeUPX2GE pic.twitter.com/oyJTCw7La4 Ballot initiatives are always an uphill climb, but Big Oil is taking no chances. As of this writing, the No on 1631 campaign has raised $26.2 million. That is more money than has ever been marshaled for an initiative campaign, ever, in Washington history. (The previous record-holder was $22.45 million spent by opponents of a GMO food-labeling initiative in 2013.) And almost all of that money is coming from oil companies outside the state. According to the Public Disclosure Commission, donations and in-kind contributions have come from BP ($9.5 million), Valero, and, of course, Koch Industries. Here are the top dozen donors: Meanwhile, Clean Air Clean Energy WA, the group backing 1631, has not quite reached $15 million, mostly from state environmental groups and civic-minded billionaires like Michael Bloomberg and Bill Gates. This extreme funding imbalance has resulted in a blizzard of misleading No on 1631 ads on local television. (I can testify — during the World Series, it was relentless, and I didn’t see a single Yes on 1631 ad.) The ads claim the carbon fee is too big (it will crush families!) and that it’s too small (it won’t reduce carbon emissions at all!), that it exempts the state’s biggest polluters (it exempts one, which is already scheduled to close) [*see clarification at bottom], and that the revenue will go into an unaccountable slush fund (it won’t). One of the ads features Rob McKenna, identified only as a “Consumer Advocate & Washington State Attorney General 2005-2013.” It fails to mention that the law firm he works for, Orrick, Herrington, and Sutcliffe, lobbies for Chevron, which has donated $500,000 to the No on 1631 campaign. Washingtonians for Ethical Government has filed a complaint with the state bar association. INBOX: activist attorney Knoll Lowney has filed state bar complaint on behalf of ""Washingtonians for Ethical Government"" (3-yr-old activist group of @avilleneuve) against @RobMcKenna over this ad. https://t.co/IGtAZZxIWo The deluge of out-of-state corporate money flooding into Washington this year has gotten so bad that state lawmakers are talking about new campaign-finance laws. Still, Big Oil has more than enough money to bulldoze past any complaints and run out the clock. It’s easier to flood the zone now and apologize afterward. Washington is seeing the asymmetry between Big Oil and its opponents play out in real time, and the same thing is happening in Colorado. In Colorado, something pretty wild is happening: Proposition 112, a ballot initiative that would effectively take a sledgehammer to the state’s oil and gas industry, gathered enough signatures to get on the ballot. Currently, the state requires new oil or gas wells to be set back 500 feet from homes and 1,000 feet from schools. Prop 112 would increase that setback to 2,500 feet from any occupied building or “vulnerable” area like waterways or green spaces. At a stroke, it would increase the off-limits land around a qualifying structure from 18 to 450 acres. Ah, the joy of Democrats campaigning in ballot initiative states. @BernieSanders is in Colorado today; every speaker in Boulder faced chants of ""endorse 112,"" an anti-fracking measure that Dems are skittish about. According to state legislative analysis, 112 would put about 85 percent of Colorado’s non-federal land off-limits to drilling — 94 percent in the five most oil-heavy counties. (Federal land is exempted, and covers 36 percent of the state’s total surface area, but that’s almost entirely in the west and very little east of the Rockies, were many wells are located.) Opponents say 112 would devastate the industry, eliminate thousands of jobs, and reduce state tax revenue. Proponents point out that natural resource extraction jobs are less than 1 percent of state jobs, the industry gets more in state subsidies than it pays in taxes, and the health benefits will outweigh the costs. Proposition 112: Dissecting the science behind the oil and gas setbacks initiative https://t.co/mGZZK332q2 pic.twitter.com/iHH6nEPCuk Whatever the merits, it has Big Oil completely freaked out. Protect Colorado, the group leading the opposition, has raised $35.6 million so far, overwhelmingly from the oil and gas industry, companies like PDC Energy, Anadarko Petroleum, SRC Energy, and Noble Energy. Noble is a particularly notable case. It is funneling millions of dollars into TV ads in the state, in a way that it says bypasses disclosure laws. David Sirota and Chase Woodruff report: “The maneuver — which pioneers a novel way for corporations to circumvent disclosure statutes and inject money directly into elections — has been blessed by the office of Colorado Secretary of State Wayne Williams, who has led a Republican political group bankrolled by [Noble].” Sounds totally above-board! Meanwhile, Colorado Rising, the group backing the initiative, has raised [checks notes] a little more than $800,000 (just $34.8 million to go!). The initiative has proven too bold and sweeping for the tastes of mainstream environmental groups and the Democratic Party, neither of which have coughed up a penny. It’s just some individual donors, Food & Water Watch, and, intriguingly, Google co-founder Sergey Brin’s family foundation. It’s not exactly a fair fight. So, $47 million, on just these two initiatives, just this year. That’s the tip of the iceberg. Koch money, especially as funneled through state groups like Americans for Prosperity, killed a bold public-transit initiative in Nashville this year — just the latest in more than two dozen local- and state-level transit efforts they have rallied against, including an important one in Phoenix. They’ve also joined in a fight against a clean-energy initiative in Arizona, against which the state utility has now spent $22 million. The current effort to repeal the recent gas tax increase in California — the disastrously misguided Proposition 6 — is backed by a vaguely named group Reform California. It’s unclear who’s funding that group, but ... c’mon. This is no great revelation: Despite its recent happy talk to the contrary, the oil and gas industry is going to fight the transition to a cleaner, less polluted economy every step of the way, on the ground, in local communities, where the rubber hits the road. Big Oil — the wealthiest companies in the world, ideologically committed billionaires, and the Republican Party that does their bidding — has a lot of money to spend, with fewer and fewer restraints imposed by campaign finance law. (And a newly robust conservative majority on the Supreme Court, sure to further loosen what restraints remain.) The only counterweight to this enormous financial advantage is people power — organized citizen resistance. But it takes an enormous amount of people power, and right now, the climate side of these fights is fragmented, siloed, and woefully underfunded. If direct democracy holds any hope of overcoming the power of fossil fuel incumbents, the left is going to have to bring its full, coordinated, organized weight to bear in each one of these fights, as Big Oil does. Small, scrappy citizen groups, as much as we may romanticize them, simply aren’t equipped to win battles at this scale. *Clarification, October 29, 2018: In a post on his personal website, Yoram Baumann, the founder and leader of the I-732 campaign in 2016, calls this a deliberate lie and says I should be fired. So let’s take a look. The ads say that 1631 exempts many of the state’s biggest polluters. There are two ways to interpret that. In both cases, the statement is incorrect. One interpretation is that individual polluters are making corrupt sweetheart deals with the backers of 1631 to exempt themselves. Only one polluter conceivably fits that description: Washington’s last remaining coal plant, the TransAlta plant in Centralia. In 2011, environmentalists and then-Gov. Christine Gregoire made a deal with the plant’s owners: It would shut down by 2025; in exchange, until then, it would be shielded from further regulations. 1631 honors the deal — the one instance in which the initiative exempts a polluter that otherwise would have been covered by the fee. I-732 did not honor the Transalta deal, and I think that was the right way to go. It’s a bum deal. Times have changed. The plant should be shut down ASAP. Nevertheless: that’s what I meant when I said there’s only one exemption. There is, however, a class of exemptions, namely energy-intensive, trade-exposed (EITE) businesses. These are carbon-intensive businesses like aluminum and steel that are highly exposed to international competition. The fear is, if they are forced to pay the carbon fee, they will be disadvantaged relative to competitors, they will shut down, the business will move abroad, and emissions will merely be shifted, not reduced. Every carbon tax system grapples with this problem. (The one just implemented in Canada has EITE exemptions.) Some systems exempt more classes of business, some fewer. 1631 exempts 23 business classes, which is about average. Interestingly, 732 did not have any EITE exemptions. Instead, it eliminated the business and operating tax on manufacturers — an attempt to keep their overall tax burden steady, while preserving the carbon-reduction incentive. It wasn’t a crazy idea, but it got 732 backers bashed for giving handouts to Boeing, et. al. The ideal solution would be eliminating EITE exemptions, and instead implementing some kind of border-adjustment tax based on carbon content — that would equalize the competitive effects while preserving the incentive. But most states and provinces, including Washington, do not have the legal authority to do this. So EITE exemptions are the second-best solution. Is No On 1631 criticizing the EITE exemptions? Should we interpret the ad that way? That is a ... generous reading, for a few reasons. For one thing, according to the Washington Department of Ecology data, EITE businesses represent just under 5 percent of Washington state emissions. Among the state’s top 20 emitters, aside from the TransAlta plant, there is one EITE business, an Alcoa plant. That makes two exemptions among “the state’s top polluters.” Is two “many”? I don’t think so. I’ll leave it to the reader to decide if I should be fired for that. Perhaps No On 1631 just doesn’t think there should be EITE exemptions at all. That would be a peculiar position for a purportedly pro-business group to take, since EITE is all about protecting in-state business competitiveness. It would mean they are attacking 1631 from the climate left, which is not where the No campaign is typically located. Put in this way: If the ad is implying corruption and rampant side-dealing, it is dishonest. If it is attacking the EITE exemptions, it is even more dishonest. You’d have trouble finding a policy analyst in the world that recommends doing nothing for EITE businesses. Anyone concerned about competitiveness should view the EITE exemptions as a feature, not a bug, of 1631. Most likely, the ad doesn’t mean anything in particular — it’s just a well-funded attempt to inject fear, uncertainty, and doubt into the debate as the vote approaches.",https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/10/26/18026074/koch-industries-bp-colorado-washington-fracking-carbon-tax,,Vox
44,2019-06-10 00:00:00,2019,6.0,10,Andrew Chung,U.S. Supreme Court to hear BP unit's dispute over Montana Superfund site,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to a hear a bid by a unit of British oil major BP Plc to avoid a lawsuit by private landowners in Montana seeking to force the company to pay for a more extensive cleanup of a Superfund hazardous waste site than what federal environmental officials had ordered.   The justices took up Atlantic Richfield Co’s appeal of a lower court ruling allowing a lawsuit by a group of property owners within the sprawling site of its former Anaconda copper smelter in western Montana to proceed to trial. Atlantic Richfield already has spent $470 million on soil and ground water restoration at the site ordered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.   The company, which is backed by industry groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers in the case, has said the lower court’s decision could lead to thousands more lawsuits nationwide against companies and further complicate federally mandated improvements to contaminated land.   The Superfund program, started in 1980, is intended to identify contaminated sites and ensure that those responsible for the pollution pay for the hazardous waste cleanup. It has been criticized over the years for slow efforts.   The Anaconda smelter, near the small community of Opportunity, Montana, operated between 1884 and 1980 and provided much of the world’s copper supply. It was designated a Superfund site in 1983 to reduce arsenic contamination in residential yards, pastures and ground water.   The landowners sued in state court to restore their properties to pre-smelter conditions. Atlantic Richfield said such state law claims were barred by the EPA’s actions under the 1980 Superfund law, called the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act.   The company also said the suit was prohibited under the U.S. Constitution’s so-called Supremacy Clause, which holds that federal law generally trumps state law.  In 2017, the Montana Supreme Court, the state’s highest court, ruled against Atlantic Richfield, allowing the case to move forward. Appealing to the Supreme Court, Atlantic Richfield said that decision could undermine the already-complex Superfund regime and leave companies open to thousands more lawsuits. It also could be forced to redo its work at the Anaconda site, the company said.  “This is the very definition of madness,” the company said in a legal brief.   President Donald Trump’s administration has said the Montana court improperly ruled in favor of the landowners but agreed that the case should proceed to trial before the justices hear it.   Also on Monday, the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal by Canada’s Teck Resources Ltd of a lower federal court’s decision holding the company liable under the Superfund law for pollution that settled in Washington state from a smelter in British Columbia. The company said the law cannot be applied outside U.S. borders.

The high-sea chase is the latest step in Greenpeace’s nine-day effort to stop the 40,000 tonne Paul Loyd JNR rig from reaching the Vorlich oilfield to start its drilling campaign.  The vessel left Cromarty Firth, north of Inverness, Scotland on Friday after police twice removed activists who had climbed and spent several days on one of the rig’s legs.  But it was forced to turn away twice from its destination over the past 48 hours as Greenpeace’s Arctic Sunrise vessel followed it, the activist group said.  The Paul Loyd JNR is currently heading west toward Peterhead and away from the Vorlich field, according to Greenpeace and www.marinetraffic.com ship tracking website.  “We are determined to stop BP drilling new oil wells in the North Sea,” Sarah North, Greenpeace International climate activist on the Arctic Sunrise said in a statement.  BP slammed Greenpeace and said it had secured an injunction against the Arctic Sunrise.      “Given Greenpeace’s repeated interference and reckless actions directed at our lawful business and their continued illegal defiance of court orders and police action, we have ... this injunction as a precautionary measure to protect the safety of people and operations,” a BP spokesman said in a statement.      BP announced last year plans to invest 200 million pounds  ($251.16 million) to develop the Vorlich field in the central North Sea which holds some 30 million barrels of oil and gas equivalent.  It is expected to start production in 2020 with an output of 20,000 barrels per day, according to BP’s website.

46,2016-05-18 00:00:00,2016,5.0,18,Claire Voon,Protesters Disrupt a BP-Sponsored Exhibition at the British Museum,"Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads Art activist group BP or not BP? yesterday staged a double intervention at the British Museum to protest BP’s sponsorship of Sunken cities, a new exhibition showcasing artifacts from two ancient, submerged Egyptian ports. Part of the Art Not Oil coalition, the protestors have since 2012 been calling for the museum — among other UK institutions — to end its sponsorship deal with the oil giant, but this new exhibition for them captures every misgiving they have about the relationship: “BP driving climate change, doing dodgy deals with repressive regimes, and using the museum to distract attention from or even legitimize both,” as BP or Not BP?’s Jess Worth wrote to Hyperallergic in an email. The actions occurred on the day of the exhibition’s press and VIP openings, taking the form of a large installation showcasing crude oil from the Gulf Coast as well as a performance later that afternoon that involved performers sitting on the museum floor, drenched in water and chanting, “We do not accept BP’s vision of the future.” Sunken cities focuses on what the museum calls “the lost cities” of Thonis-Heracleion and Canopus, which both lay underwater near the mouth of the Nile for over a thousand years before a French archaeological team began its excavations. What led to their sinking were natural phenomena such as rising sea levels and tidal wave-causing earthquakes — the same risks coastal cities face today, thanks to climate change, which the fossil fuel industry drives. “We are always concerned that the museum is allowing BP a credibility and legitimacy that it doesn’t deserve by associating itself so prominently with great art and culture,” BP or Not BP?’s Jess Worth told Hyperallergic in an email. “But this exhibition is beyond the pale … it’s beyond parody.” Worth cites BP’s history of doing business with the Egyptian government under the repressive regimes of Mubarak, Morsi, and el-Sisi — deals that make the company one of the country’s largest foreign investors. BP’s website describes that it is “actively exploring in the Nile Delta and investing to add production from existing discoveries.” When you consider the fact that cities in the Delta region such as Alexandria, Damietta, and Port Said are currently sinking from climate change, BP’s sponsorship of Sunken cities becomes even more paradoxical and problematic. For its interventions, BP or Not BP? highlighted the cases of human rights violations under the political systems whose leaders BP has struck deals with during its 50 years of operating in Egypt. To represent the 340 cases of enforced disappearance last year under the leadership of el-Sisi, the protestors in the morning created a circle of 340 black stones. The rocks surrounded a plinth supporting a bottle of crude oil and a teargas cartridge originally used in Cairo to represent the weapons employed to repress the 2011 Tahrir Square protests. Worth points out that in March 2014, a few months before the documentation of the crackdowns began, BP had signed a $12 billion dollar energy deal in Egypt. The protestors left around 1pm after holding a moment of silence to show solidarity with those in Egypt who are resisting el-Sisi’s regime, but they returned to the Great Court during the exhibition’s evening VIP launch. While someone read out a list of cities likely to be underwater over the coming decades if the oil industry does not change its habits, a man acting as a BP representative poured water on 10 chanting performers. The list, based on projected sea levels recently reported in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, included one of the Solomon Islands, threatened to sink this year; Malé, the Maldives’ capital, at risk of submergence in 2020; and Amsterdam, under water in possibly 2025. To represent the projected flooding of London in 2060, the BP character poured water over his own head, concluding the performance. According to Worth, museum staff attempted to divert the attentions of the VIP guests, which included representatives from BP and the Egyptian government. As the Evening Standard reported, however, trustees in attendance — including Grayson Perry — remained well aware of the actions and apparently found it difficult to hear the museum’s speeches. Police arrived later, but by then, the protestors were on their way out. Part of BP or Not BP’s outrage also stems from BP’s framing of the exhibition, as exemplified in a problematic BP-written promotional wall text. “As fellow explorers of the Nile Delta, we feel a strong affinity with the maritime archaeologists who have discovered the sunken cities of Thonis-Heracleion and Canopus,” the plaque reads. “Our support for this special exhibition is part of BP’s wider commitment to enhancing people’s lives, in the UK and beyond. Our aim is to enable more people to experience the very best in art and culture.” Besides demonstrating BP’s flawed logic that searching for oil and gas creates a bond between it and archaeologists, the text illustrates how contributing a likely small amount to museum funding buys it a large claim to cultural philanthropy and stewardship. BP or Not BP? is not calling on the British Museum to halt Sunken Cities, but the group is hoping the museum faces increased pressure to not renew its five-year sponsorship deal with BP, which is currently under discussion and scheduled to conclude next year. Hyperallergic has reached out to the museum but did not receive comment.  “For BP and Egypt, Sunken cities is an extension of this brutal business relationship, facilitated by the British Museum,” Worth told Hyperallergic. “This is very clear in BP and the Egyptian government’s communications around the exhibition. So we feel the museum will continue to be complicit in BP’s carbon-intensive, rights-abusing business activities until it ends its sponsorship deal.” Yesterday’s intervention also brightens the spotlight on BP ethics in relation to its cultural partnerships, which have recently come under close scrutiny. As Hyperallergic previously reported, Art Not Oil has released internal documents of correspondence between the oil giant and its partner institutions that suggest myriad instances in which BP infringed on its role of sponsor to influence museum operations.",https://hyperallergic.com/299780/protesters-disrupt-a-bp-sponsored-exhibition-at-the-british-museum/,,Hyperallergic

It's the second time in recent months that cash-strapped Alabama has tapped into the same pool of funds for a controversial project, raising questions among watchdog groups about how that money is being spent. Environmental groups call it another example of state officials playing fast and loose with money that was supposed to be spent restoring the Gulf after the 2010 blowout, which still leaves tar balls washing up on the state's roughly 100-mile coastline. ""There was no lodge or conference center actually physically injured by the oil,"" said Cynthia Sarthou, the head of the Gulf Restoration Network, which sued Alabama over funding for the project. ""Nobody was stopped from going to a conference center in Alabama because of the oil, because there wasn't a conference center."" And Casi Callaway, executive director of the conservation group Mobile Baykeeper, said she has no problem with the state building a conference center — but ""under no circumstances"" should it be done with money that was meant for coastal restoration.

Related: BP Just Agreed to Pay $19 Billion in Damages for the 2010 Deepwater Horizon Disaster Alabama is grappling with another financial crunch, leaving Gov. Robert Bentley threatening to veto the budget state lawmakers just sent him this week. The two-term Republican is not only embroiled in a sex scandal, he's also under fire for giving some senior officials raises of more than $70,000 while public services face cuts. So state officials are boasting that the $135 million, 350-room oceanfront hotel and conference center won't cost taxpayers a dime. It would replace a more modest state park lodge that was wiped out in 2004, when Hurricane Ivan slammed into the beach resort of Gulf Shores. It's the second most-expensive project to date in the Gulf restoration effort, behind a $318 million effort to restore Louisiana's coast and barrier islands. In February, a federal judge ruled the state couldn't use nearly $60 million in early restoration funding it received from BP as part of the Natural Resource Damage Assessment process, since it didn't study any alternative plans. But US District Judge Charles Butler said he couldn't stop the state from using other money to pay for the project. And the state is doing just that, arguing that the new hotel will help pay for other state parks that are facing cutbacks. ""Once complete, park visitors will have even more reasons to visit: from overnight an classroom educational facilities to expanded bike paths — even one of the first Living Buildings in the South, bringing them closer to the unique ecology and environment that exists in Alabama's Gulf Shores,"" said Cooper Shattuck, a University of Alabama lawyer who is overseeing the project. ""One aspect of this project that should be emphasized is that the lodge will be the economic engine that allows Gulf State Park — as well as other parks around the state — to function. Right now, many are operating at a deficit and face closure."" 'They're funny about not wanting to let you, me, or anybody else know.' BP has already put up $1 billion for early restoration projects, a kind of down payment on the $20 billion-plus settlement that now awaits approval in a New Orleans courtroom. Alabama will get about $2 billion from that settlement, Attorney General Luther Strange announced in October. About $86 million of settlement money will pay for the conference center, Shattuck said. But State Auditor Jim Ziegler said the rest will come from another settlement between BP and Alabama, which the state has already touched for another widely criticized project — the restoration of a crumbling, George Wallace-era governor's beach house that's estimated to cost up to $1.8 million. Callway said that the nearly six-year-old pot of money was originally meant to compensate Alabama for lost tourism during the spill, when many vacationers picked someplace other than the Gulf Coast to go for the summer. Now she and others want to know how much is left in that pot, and what else it financed. ""BP said 'You lost some money. Here's some pocket change.' But it's turning out that was a lot more than pocket change,"" Callaway said. ""We didn't know how much it was exactly, we didn't know how to apply for it, how to get it, how it was spent, anything."" And though the conference center will be more upscale than the old lodge it replaces, at least it's open to the public: ""The governor's mansion is limited use, limited access,"" she said. ""Nobody can go unless you know the governor, I guess."" Ziegler, an outspoken critic of the beach house renovation, said Thursday he's also interested in finding out how much of the 2010 BP grant the state still has at its disposal. ""We're trying to get those figures now. They're funny about not wanting to let you, me, or anybody else know,"" Ziegler said. Related: Alabama's Governor Uses Oil Spill Funds to Renovate Coastal Mansion Bentley's office did not return phone calls seeking comment Thursday. His office has said the beach retreat will be used for economic development, hosting executives of companies weighing new ventures in Alabama. The property had been left vacant after Hurricane Danny battered the Gulf coast in 1997, and its renovation raised eyebrows in part because Bentley had just lost his own beach home in an abrupt divorce from his wife of 50 years. Long-simmering rumors of an extramarital affair behind that split erupted into public view this week when Bentley's just-fired chief of the state law enforcement agency accused the governor of having an affair with his top political adviser. That left Bentley apologizing Wednesday for ""inappropriate"" recorded conversations with the adviser — but denying allegations of a sexual relationship. BP declined comment on the grant funds. But Sarthou said she'd like to know how Alabama can keep coming back to the earlier settlement for Gulf projects. ""It's very unclear to me how they're spending the same pot of money several times, unless the pot is really large,"" she said.

48,2018-10-29 00:00:00,2018,10.0,29,Christine Ro,A BP Oil Protest Spills Through the British Museum’s Protest Exhibition,"BP or not BP? gathered in opposition of oil giant BP’s financial stake at the British Museum, accusing the company of bolstering its political positioning through its arts investments. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads LONDON — On October 27, a little after 2 pm, the British Museum saw a modest, yet affecting, protest in its exhibition I object: Ian Hislop’s search for dissent. A small group of artists from protest group BP or not BP? began unpacking props and distributing flyers, clad in bright red shirts reading “I OBJECT TO BP.” Since 2012, the group has been staging eye-catching performances to protest British oil giant BP’s sponsorship of major UK cultural institutions, including the Royal Shakespeare Company. This Saturday, their aim was to challenge the British Museum’s continuing partnership with BP, a controversial financial sponsor of the institution. I object utilizes the British Museum’s vast collection to show how protest spans time and space with “intriguing objects that explore the idea of dissent, subversion, and satire.” Among the galleries are Turkish shadow puppets from 1820–1920 which satirize politicians, and, of course, Banksy’s prank at the British Museum — a fabricated cave painting that was left inside the galleries for three days before staff realized it didn’t belong there. On Saturday, the seven protestors from BP or not BP? approached visitors, explaining: “We’re staging a protest inside the protest exhibition today, because we think there’s quite an irony in that BP is sponsoring this museum when they so often squash protest.” Four of them held objects and explanatory text of their own. One was a photo of the Colombian union leader Gilberto Torres, who sued BP for indirect links to his kidnapping. Another was the Morning Star flag used by the independence movement in West Papua, where the Indonesian military crushed protests related to foreign resource extraction. A tear gas canister from Cairo represented BP’s investments in Egypt, whose government has cracked down on dissent. Finally, BP or not BP? member Hannah Boustred was wearing her own protest item: a bright blue vest and bowtie reportedly confiscated by British Museum security staff during a previous performance. “You kind of have to earn the right to put on the exhibition,” said Danny Chivers, of BP or not BP? The organization is one of several challenging contended financial entanglements of European institutions. In September, over 40 artists withdrew their work from London’s Design Museum, and put on their own alternative exhibition to protest the museum’s relationship with weapons manufacturer Leonardo. Art Not Oil has been protesting BP’s sponsorship of the National Portrait Gallery for years. In Paris, Libérons le Louvre has demonstrated against Total’s sponsorship of the Louvre. There have been some successes along the way. Following six years of demonstrations by Liberate Tate, BP finally ended its sponsorship of the Tate in 2016. And it was recently announced that the National Gallery is no longer being sponsored by Shell. A major target of these protests has been the British Museum, where BP or not BP? has now staged 32 demonstrations. Previous BP or not BP? protests at the British Museum have included a mock funeral and a “splashmob,” or an ocean-themed flashmob whose centerpiece was a kraken. In the view of BP or not BP?, the BP–British Museum relationship is far from harmless. “BP uses the museum to push its geopolitical position,” said Chivers. He points to the BP sponsorship of an exhibition on ancient Siberia, tied to its oil-drilling ambitions in the Russian Arctic. This exhibition occasioned meetings among Russian and British officials, energy industry representatives, and museum staff. Similarly, a Day of the Dead celebration held at the museum coincided with efforts to achieve oil-drilling leases in Mexico. This is one of a number of events revealing uncomfortably close relationships among museum and BP representatives. BP’s influence over curatorial decisions and its use of these prestigious cultural links to legitimize its business decisions belie the argument that its sponsorship is benign. Chivers rejected the argument that these museums need funding from large multinationals to continue their programming. He says that arts funding cuts in the UK disproportionately affect small local museums, which aren’t the ones being courted by oil companies. “[BP’s] not interested in sponsoring the local museum in Stoke-on-Trent,” he said. The group believes that the small sliver of income received from BP should be replaced by government funding or, if necessary, “ethical sponsorship.” On Saturday, the response from the British Museum’s security team was muted. It took over an hour for exhibition staff to realize that the protestors weren’t actually a part of the exhibition. Even then, as more security staffers entered the space and asked the activists about their activities, the mood was gentle. One staffer said, looking perplexed, “I don’t think there’s anything we can do.” He worried that the protest might be a distraction for the paying visitors, but conceded that no visitors had complained. A senior member of security later suggested that ultimately, the protest might be good publicity for the exhibition and that they should wait it out. Overall, the position was of slightly bewildered tolerance. A British Museum spokesperson later commented to Hyperallergic: The British Museum respects other people’s right to express their views and allows peaceful protest onsite at the Museum as long as there is no risk to the Museum’s collection, staff or visitors. The long-term support provided by BP allows the Museum to plan its programming in advance and to bring world cultures to a global audience through hugely popular exhibitions and their associated public programmes. Over 4.2 million people have enjoyed an activity at the Museum supported by BP. For the BP or not BP? activists, this attitude allowed for plenty of discussion with museumgoers. As protestor Ali Warrington explained during the performance on Saturday, “Many people might not make the connection why it’s so inappropriate for a publicly funded museum to take money from an oil corporation.” Some conversations centered around corporate sponsorship for arts funding in general. The I object exhibition, for instance, has prominent branding for its sponsor, Citi. Plenty of visitors were surprised to learn just how small BP’s financial contribution is to the British Museum (less than .5% of the museum’s income, according to BP or not BP?). While many visitors supported BP or not BP?’s opposition to the fossil fuel industry, some questioned the world’s ability to wean itself off oil. Chivers said that the group’s aim is to build on each previous protest: “Every time, we try to push the boundaries a bit further in terms of what we can get away with.” This is tailored to the specific circumstances. Sometimes that might be a noisy flashmob with massive props. Other times, as on Saturday, the demonstration was less in-your-face. The group had prepared plenty of contingency plans for the event and initially expected to remain fixed in place in a corner of the exhibition space. But as they were mostly left alone by security, they felt free to wander around engaging with people. Chivers explained that their ultimate target is the museum’s trustees and management: “The best way to embarrass them is to show how much support there is for our position among the visitors and the staff.” As the activists left just before closing time, they sang “I object to BP / make museums fossil free.” It was an amiable ending to a polite few hours of protest.",https://hyperallergic.com/468466/a-bp-oil-protest-spills-through-the-british-museums-protest-exhibition/,,Hyperallergic
49,2018-01-19 00:00:00,2018,1.0,19,Benjamin Sutton,New Dossier Shows British Museum Had a Role in Dealings Between BP and Russia,"Newly public emails show correspondence between the museum, Russia’s London embassy, British officials, and BP. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads On Sunday, visitors to the British Museum were met with a 36-foot-tall banner visualizing the 2,727 oil spills caused in one region during one year by Rosneft, the state-controlled Russian energy giant in which BP, a highly visible sponsor of the museum, has a major stake. The activists who unfurled the banner, members of the activist collective BP Or Not BP?, also dropped more than 2,000 pieces of confetti shaped like drops of oil into the Great Court, each one symbolizing a spill by the BP affiliate in Russia. The performative protest marked the closing of the BP-sponsored exhibition Scythians: Warriors of Ancient Siberia and was intended in part to call attention to a trove of documents made public the following day by Culture Unstained, a group lobbying to end the fossil fuel industry’s sponsorship of cultural events and institutions. The extensive “Crude Connections” dossier includes an interactive graphic and a timeline of meetings and email correspondence between British and Russian officials, and representatives of BP, the British Museum, and the State Hermitage Museum. It sheds some light on opaque dealings between politicians and energy company executives, and cultural sponsorship’s role in facilitating and legitimizing those activities. “We’ve seen BP use previous British Museum exhibitions as opportunities to cozy up to repressive regimes in countries where it wants to drill, such as Mexico and Egypt,” Helen Glynn of BP Or Not BP? told Hyperallergic. “This time, BP’s purpose seems to be subtly different — its sponsorship of the Scythians exhibition fits into a wider strategy of trying to rehabilitate the Russian government in the eyes of Western policymakers, in an effort to weaken the sanctions that prevent BP from getting its drills into the Russian Arctic. When the Russian Ambassador and BP are given places of honor at a British Museum event, that sends a strong signal to the British establishment — that there’s nothing wrong with BP working with the Russian government.” The email correspondence Culture Unstained obtained through Freedom of Information requests includes, for instance, a public affairs manager at the British Museum arranging a private meeting in May 2017 between Alexander Vladimirovich Yakovenko, the Russian ambassador to the UK, two unnamed BP employees, and the British Museum’s director (Hartwig Fischer) and chair of trustees (Richard Lambert) the morning of the press launch of Scythians: Warriors of Ancient Siberia. A follow-up email from the Russian embassy described the meeting as “very useful and positive.” At the exhibition’s official opening in September 2017, Yakovenko made a speech praising, among others, BP. “I’m hugely grateful to the Hermitage and other museums from Kazakhstan and UK that contributed to it,” he said, “the British Museum that brought it to life with great storytelling, and, of course, the BP that has such a remarkable record of supporting cultural and scientific ties between our two nations.” Though the documents gathered by Culture Unstained don’t include any specifically illegal activities, they do suggest a pattern of BP’s cultural sponsorship serving as a pretext to bring together government officials and agents of the energy industry. The correspondence in the “Crude Connections” dossier is all the more interesting because the British Museum’s Scythians exhibition coincided with the period when the US Senate imposed new sanctions on Russia, and the trove of emails shows the lengths to which BP and British and Russian officials went to respond to and lobby against the sanctions. In short, the documents offer glimpses of a network of influence usually concealed from the public, and in which the British Museum plays a not insignificant role. To help make that network more easily intelligible, “Crude Connections” also includes a very extensive infographic mapping the many connections between BP and Rosneft, the British and Russian governments, and cultural institutions including the British Museum, the Royal Shakespeare Company, and London’s Science Museum. “Institutions like the British Museum are supposed to be accountable to the public via their trustees,” Glynn said. “We’d love it if more people contacted the British Museum’s Board of Trustees to ask: what scrutiny was carried out before signing this new five-year BP deal? Were the trustees aware that a third of BP’s business and a quarter of its profits are tied up with the notoriously polluting Russian state oil company Rosneft — a company currently embroiled in a major corruption scandal? If so, then why on earth did they sign off on this deal, at a time when there is so much international concern about the activities of the Russian government?” BP’s sponsorship of the British Museum has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, and has been the subject of many protest performances. Though BP ended its sponsorship agreement with Tate in 2016 following public pressure and protests by groups like Liberate Tate, it renewed a similar deal with the British Museum that same year, which will carry through to 2021.

Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads Campaigners for fossil-fuel-free culture have sent a formal complaint to London’s National Portrait Gallery (NPG), alleging that the institution’s sponsorship deal with British Petroleum (BP) breaches its own ethics policies. Submitted by the research group Culture Unstained, the document calls for the museum to cut its ties with BP because of the oil company’s multiple connections to foreign regimes that violate human rights — an argument that underscores climate change as a human rights issue. The group, which is part of the Art Not Oil coalition, has also published an online, in-depth report detailing BP’s international business dealings. It highlights nine case studies, from Azerbaijan to Egypt to Indonesia. The actions are timed to place pressure on the museum as it announces the winner of its 38th annual BP Portrait Award. One of the award’s judges is Des Violaris, BP’s director of arts and culture, whose involvement directly violates the NPG’s ethics standards, Culture Unstained argues. Specifically, the group cites a clause stipulating that accepting funding would not be considered appropriate “where support would impinge on the artistic or academic freedom of the Gallery or would otherwise compromise its status as an independent institution.” Culture Unstained obtained the museum’s Ethical Fundraising Policy through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Its researchers highlight two other, much more problematic clauses that suggest BP’s sponsorship of the NPG breaches the institution’s regulations: they state that the museum may reject support when “the supporting source is known or suspected to be closely associated with a regime known or suspected to be in violation of human rights” and “where support is known or suspected to derive from the proceeds of crime.” The new 33-page report, titled “Bad Company: BP, human rights, and corporate crimes,” delves into specific examples illustrating the oil company’s tainted record. It describes, among others, BP’s support of the repressive Alivyev regime in Azerbaijan; its deals with the Indonesian government to extract gas in West Papua, where indigenous Papuans are denied basic rights; and its pursuit of deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico despite the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, after which the company pled guilty to 14 criminal counts. Culture Unstained also made FOI requests to uncover the museum’s assessment of the appropriateness of BP’s sponsorship, but it received what it describes as “little evidence” to suggest that the NPG carried out a process of due diligence to examine the oil company’s disconcerting practices. Furthermore, BP announced last year that it will be extending its partnership with the NPG for another five years, as well as those with the British Museum, the Royal Shakespeare Company, and the Royal Opera House. “The Gallery needs to explain what the purpose of having an Ethical Fundraising Policy is if you’re not willing to stand by your values and put it into action,” Culture Unstained’s representative Chris Garrard said in a statement. “It’s disturbing to think the Gallery might have researched BP’s close ties to regimes that violate human rights and decided that’s the company it wants to keep. And if they failed to subject BP to proper ethical scrutiny, then there are serious questions about whether this ill-advised sponsorship deal is legitimate at all.” The complaint urges the museum to thoroughly review its decision to renew BP’s sponsorship contract, which Culture Unstained argues can only lead to the conclusion to terminate it. The group is also calling on the NPG to convene a dedicated ethics committee with representation from all levels of the museum’s workforce to properly scrutinize future situations that pose significant issues. A spokesperson for the NPG confirmed that it has received the complaint and told Hyperallergic that “we will review and respond in accordance with the Gallery’s Complaints Policy.” If the institution fails to respond to or address the concerns raised by Culture Unstained within 20 days, the group intends to submit complaints to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman as well as the Museums Association, which has helped maintain museum ethics in the UK since 1977.",https://hyperallergic.com/386289/bp-sponsorship-violates-uk-national-portrait-gallerys-ethics-policy-report-claims/,,Hyperallergic
51,2019-06-27 00:00:00,2019,6.0,27,"Ron Bousso, Dmitry Zhdannikov",Exclusive: Trade tensions put energy transition at risk - BP chairman,"LONDON (Reuters) - Trade tensions risk throwing the global economy’s transition to greener energy into disarray and could hurt energy companies’ preparations toward it, BP Chairman Helge Lund said as leaders of the world’s largest economies gather for talks in Japan.   Lund, in his first interview since taking office in January, said BP would rather see a rapid, orderly phasing out of fossil fuels than a delayed and disorganized transition.  The former chief executive of Norwegian oil group Equinor said BP as well as rivals such as Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and ExxonMobil (XOM.N) would have a vital role to play to ensure a successful transition to low carbon economies.  “It is better for us to see a path that goes rapidly,” Lund said. “It will be very difficult for the oil and gas companies but that is a better and a preferred solution than an uncontrolled sudden change maybe 10, 15 years into the future.”  London-based BP, like some of its peers, has taken steps toward meeting the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement to limit global warming, including setting targets to reduce carbon emissions from its operations, link them to managers’ pay and ensure that investments are in line with the accords.   But many investors say BP will have to do more, including tackling emissions from the fuels and products it sells to millions of customers daily, known as Scope 3 emissions, to prevent a catastrophic rise in global temperatures.   Lund said however that such Scope 3 targets would tie BP’s hands to make future investments, whether in renewable energy or oil and gas. He nevertheless said the company’s thinking around Scope 3 was likely “to evolve over time.”  BP invested around $500 million in renewable power, electric vehicle charging points and other low-carbon technologies last year, a fraction of its annual spending of $15 billion.  And the pressure on companies and governments to do more to curb greenhouse gases is rising as carbon emission levels show no sign of decreasing.  Investors managing more than $34 trillion in assets, nearly half the world’s invested capital, this week demanded urgent action from governments on climate change, piling pressure on leaders of the world’s 20 biggest economies meeting this week.  France has said it will not accept a final G20 communique that does not mention the Paris climate change agreement.  “The long-term framework around the energy transition is important. Over time it is much easier for big companies like BP if we have a stable global framework for trade and investments,” Lund told Reuters at BP’s London headquarters.  Lund said an unprecedented level of cooperation was needed between companies and governments to bring greenhouse gas emissions to zero by the end of the century.   He urged governments to introduce a price on carbon emissions to allow phasing out fossil fuels, even though only a handful of such schemes have been introduced around the world.  (Graphic: BP's CO2 emissions - tmsnrt.rs/2LHblpG)  BP has faced a wave of protests by climate activists, including a blockade on its London office and protests at events the company sponsors.  Big investors, including Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, are reviewing shareholdings in some oil and gas drillers, though not in BP and its largest rivals.  Lund, who took part in discussions on a climate resolution with a group of investors earlier this year, believes most investors understand that modern societies are almost built on hydrocarbons.  BP forecasts that even with a rapid increase in wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy, fossil fuels will account for the majority of energy supply for decades to come.       Lund also warned that attempts to curb fossil fuels too fast could harm societies.  “It takes time to change energy systems ... If you try to build down the oil and gas industry quicker than you are able to build up a carbon neutral system you will pull societies back.”  Lund said large oil companies would be vital for the transition due to their large balance sheets, technical expertise and innovation skills.  “To be a strong contributor in the long term we have to stay financially strong, we have to be a good investment.”  Lund also said: “There is another dimension that we need to think about and that is if you believe that BP and other integrated oil and gas companies understand energy markets, they have significant balance sheets, they have technical capabilities, they have innovation capabilities, they can take risks - so in my mind business and these companies play an incredibly important role in the energy transition.”  Lund, 56, faces the task of leading BP through the energy transition and also overseeing the succession to Chief Executive Bob Dudley, who took the helm in 2010 following the crisis over the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico.   Dudley also steered BP through the oil industry’s worst downturn in decades so that the company is now producing strong profits which reached a five-year high last year of $12.7 billion.  “Bob is a very good leader, I am not sure where BP would have been without him,” Helge said.  BP’s board would ensure that when Dudley, who turns 65 next year, steps down, there will be “at least a number of candidates who can compete for the job,” he added.      Lund, a former consultant and political adviser in the Norwegian parliament rejected suggestions he could replace Dudley to become the next CEO.  “I’ve been CEO for three companies. I thought about this when I left BG whether I should try to get one more (CEO) job or try to get a different life and I decided on the latter and I think it is rewarding,” he said.

52,2019-06-26 00:00:00,2019,6.0,26,Ron Bousso,BP gets back into animal feed with $30 million Calysta investment,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP is returning to the animal feed business a quarter of a century after exiting the sector.  The London-based oil and gas company said it is investing $30 million in Calysta Inc., which produces protein for fish, livestock and pet food.  Natural gas is pumped through a fermenter, and the microorganisms, from naturally occurring microbes found in soil, metabolize the gas as their sole source of energy, producing a high-protein biomass.  While a relatively large investment for BP’s venture division, which typically puts money into new technologies focused on the transition to low-carbon energy, it is small fry for a company that announced a $2.4 billion profit for the first quarter.  The oil giant, which has come under increasing pressure from climate activists, has been working with shareholders in recent years to try to define a path towards meeting the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement to limit global warming.  Calysta could, however, become an important buyer of gas for BP as demand for protein-based animal feed is expected to rise by 80% by 2050 as the world’s population grows and diets change, BP’s vice president for long-term planning Dominic Emery said.  “This could become a reasonably material part of our gas supply business over time,” Emery told Reuters. The business is expected to generate profits for BP in the next few years, he added.  The technology may help meet the growing demand for feed in a more sustainable way by using less water and agricultural land.  California-based Calysta operates a production facility in Teesside in eastern England.  BP and peers including Royal Dutch Shell and Total are betting on growing demand for natural gas, the least polluting fossil fuel, as the world transitions to cleaner forms of energy.  While most of the gas is consumed for power and heating, the companies are also looking for other outlets such as truck and marine transportation and industries.  BP built in the 1980s a sprawling nutrition business with products ranging from pet food to fish farms. It sold most of the struggling division by 1994 for over $1.5 billion in order to focus on its oil and gas business.  BP Venture’s senior principal David Hayes will take a seat on the board of Calysta, BP said.

The British oil and gas company said it has decided to relinquish its 50 percent interest in Block 24/11 off the coast of southern Angola and that Katambi, a gas discovery made in the block in 2014, had been deemed uncommercial. “The write-off is fairly chunky, even by BP’s standards, for one asset,” said Jack Allardyce, oil and gas analyst at Cenkos Securities. The charge will not impact cash flow and will not attract tax relief, BP said. A number of companies including France’s Total (TOTF.PA), Norway’s Statoil STL.OL and Maersk Oil have explored for oil and gas off Africa’s western coast in recent years but have made few commercial discoveries. “The fact that (BP) are having a write-off in Angola’s Kwanza basin is not that surprising. Industry has not experienced significant success overall in the basin,” Jefferies analyst Jason Gammel said. BP has made four fossil fuel discoveries in 2017 in Trinidad, Egypt and off Senegal, all of which were gas and which the company said were part of a strategic shift to less polluting fossil fuel. “We are making disciplined choices throughout our business, including in exploration, and pursuing only opportunities that will deliver clear value for our shareholders,” Bernard Looney, head of BP’s upstream operations, said in a statement.

The blue chip FTSE 100 index was up 0.4 percent at 7,235.30 points by 0855 GMT, in line with a broadly positive European market. Oil major BP was among standout performers, its shares up 1.8 percent after its profit nearly tripled in the first quarter of 2017. Higher oil prices and production helped BP report a first-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, the company’s definition of net income, of $1.51 billion, beating analysts’ average forecast of $1.26 billion. “The broader theme is that BP is looking in better shape because of the higher oil price, and while oil prices hold their ground, BP, alongside with all of the other oil companies are going to benefit,” Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said. “Part of the attraction with BP is that they started the cost cutting before some of the big oil majors because of Deepwater (Horizon), but now as the oil price does continue to hold up, maybe you don’t necessarily want as much cost cutting anymore, you want to start expanding,” Lawler added, referring to BP’s deadly Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010.

It also saw a slowdown in the pace of outflows from its funds, a boost as the company prepares to merge with blue chip peer Standard Life, whose shares rose 2.4 percent. Just Eat fell more than 4 percent, however, after reporting first quarter results, with UK order growth in particular disappointing. “A tough quarter for (Just Eat), hard comps and some operational issues evident.

The deal will leave Aker BP with holdings of 90 percent in each field, and will help pay for projects such as the Valhall Flank West, which is estimated to come on stream in 2020. Aker BP in October announced a $2 billion deal to buy Hess Corp’s (HES.N) 64.05 percent stake in the Valhall field and 62.5 percent in Hod, raising its ownership to 100 percent, but added it would seek a partner for the license. “After we announced the Hess transaction, we have seen strong interest to partner with Aker BP in the Valhall area. Through this transaction, we get a partner that shares our ambition of developing the upside potential in these fields,” Aker BP Chief Executive Karl Johnny Hersvik said in a statement. Pandion in June won permission from Norway’s energy ministry to hold oil and gas licenses, and is backed by private equity fund manager Kerogen Capital. Aker BP’s top owners are Norwegian investment firm Aker ASA (AKER.OL) with a 40 percent stake and BP Plc (BP.L) with 30 percent. The original Hess transaction and the Pandion deal are both subject to customary approvals by regulators, which Aker BP said it expected to receive by the end of 2017.

65,2016-12-27 00:00:00,2016,12.0,27,Tom Westbrook,Australia's Woolworths sells petrol chain to BP for $1.3 billion,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s top grocer Woolworths Ltd (WOW.AX) said on Wednesday it will sell its chain of petrol stations to BP plc (BP.L) for A$1.8 billion ($1.3 billion), the latest disposal in a bid to return the company’s focus to its core supermarket business. The sale of the fuel business, comprising 527 petrol stations and 16 development sites was flagged in September and follows its earlier exit from a disastrous foray into hardware, which led to a A$1.8 billion impairment charge. “Hardware wasn’t so great ... this is another area of their business that they weren’t really managing well,” said Juliana Roadley, a market analyst at stockbroker Commonwealth Securities. Woolworths “didn’t understand” the fuel business and would be best to concentrate on selling groceries, she added. The fuel sold at Woolworths’ petrol stations is currently supplied by Caltex Australia (CTX.AX), which also bid for the business. Under the new arrangement BP will eventually supply and sell the fuel. The fuel business reported earnings before tax and significant items of A$117.8 million for the year ended June 30. Its sale “is not expected to have a material impact on Woolworths Group earnings”, the company said. “The release of A$1.785 billion from the sale will be used to strengthen our balance sheet and reinvest in our core businesses,” Woolworths Chief Executive Brad Banducci said. The 92-year-old company posted its first annual loss since its 1993 listing in August, hit hard by the hardware impairment and squeezed margins amid a price war with rival Coles, owned by Wesfarmers Ltd (WES.AX), and new entrants such as Germany’s ALDI Inc [ALDIEI.UL]. The deal, which was signed on Christmas Eve, is subject to regulatory approval and is not expected to be completed until January 2018 at the earliest, the statement said. It also involves an agreement to continue a fuel voucher scheme and the parties will jointly trial a convenience business at 200 of the petrol stations. Woolworths shares rose 2.7 percent to a two-month high in early trade, while the broader market rose 0.73 percent. BP downstream chief executive Tufan Erginbilgic said in a separate statement that it has similar and successful partnerships globally with retailers such as Marks and Spencer (MKS.L). Caltex Australia chief executive Julian Segal said in a statement he was “disappointed” that his company’s supply arrangement with Woolworths would end. Caltex shares fell as much as 2.6 percent in early trade.

67,2018-05-01 00:00:00,2018,5.0,1,Ron Bousso,BP flags possible dividend boost as profits surge,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP held out the prospect of a first dividend increase since 2014 on Tuesday, after first-quarter profits beat forecasts thanks to rising oil and gas prices and production. Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary said the London-listed company might consider raising the dividend later this year if oil prices remain near current levels and debt declines. In the first three months of 2018, however, BP’s debt rose to $40 billion due to the settlement of more lawsuits over the deadly 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico which has cost it more than $65 billion. A nearly 25 percent rise in oil prices over the past year to over $70 a barrel has lifted revenue for oil companies, shifting investors’ focus to how much cash they can generate following years of cost cuts. First-quarter results in the sector have been a mixed bag, with Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil falling short of forecasts, while results from Chevron and Total were stronger than expected. BP’s cash flow from operating activities rose sharply from a year earlier to $3.6 billion, but declined from the previous quarter as a result of the Deepwater Horizon payments and one-off charges. Stripping those out, cash flow reached $7 billion in the quarter, the strongest since 2014. “Overall it was a very healthy set of results,” said Martijn Rats, analyst at Morgan Stanley, which has a “neutral” recommendation on BP stock. BP shares were 0.9 percent higher at 0930 GMT, compared with a 0.2 percent gain in the European oil and gas index. The surge in revenue led BP last October to become the first European oil major to resume share buybacks in order to offset the dilutive effect of so-called scrip dividend, where shareholders can opt to receive dividends via cash or shares. In the first quarter, BP bought back 18 million shares worth $120 million. Investors are now hoping for the company to announce its first dividend increase since the third quarter of 2014. “With these oil prices, we will now see net debt naturally start to decline and that will give an opportunity later this year for potential further distribution around buybacks or a conversation with the board around dividend,” Gilvary told analysts on a conference call. BP’s underlying replacement cost profit, its definition of net income, rose 71 percent to $2.6 billion in the first quarter, exceeding the $2.2 billion forecast by analysts in a company-provided survey. The last time BP generated so much profit was in the third quarter of 2014, when oil prices averaged $104 a barrel. Brent crude is currently trading around $75 a barrel. [O/R] BP launched seven oil and gas fields in 2017, a record year, and is set to inaugurate six more projects this year including in Egypt, Azerbaijan and Britain’s North Sea, which will help it boost production by 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) by 2020, most of it gas. First-quarter production rose 6 percent to 3.7 million bpd. “It’s not only about the oil price, it is also about the performance of the kit,” Gilvary said. BP’s gearing, the ratio between debt and BP’s equity market value, stood at 28.1 percent at the end of the quarter, up from 27.4 percent at the end of 2017. Net debt at the end of March was $40 billion, up from $37.8 billion at the end of 2017. The results were impacted by a $1.6 billion pretax payment for the settlement of the Deepwater Horizon spill. BP is expected to pay $3 billion in 2018. Morgan Stanley’s Rats said debt was expected to fall in the second half of the year after most of the Deepwater Horizon claims are settled and production continues to rise.

68,2016-09-13 00:00:00,2016,9.0,13,Marianna Parraga,Exclusive: PDVSA payment woes drive up bill for big oil buy from BP - internal documents,"HOUSTON - Venezuela’s cash-strapped state oil giant PDVSA will end up paying at least $130 million more than it planned for crude imports after payment delays to major BP Plc, according to internal documents analyzed by Reuters. Years of underinvestment and mismanagement have impaired oil production in Venezuela, set to fall to a 14-year low in 2016, even though the country holds some of the world’s largest crude reserves. As a result, PDVSA has been forced to increasingly rely on imports to dilute its own extra-heavy crude barrels. That is why in March it made its first crude purchase from U.K.-based BP after awarding it a very large tender for which it expected to spend $230.9 million, or some $31 a barrel, in prepaid shipments of 7.4 million barrels, during the second quarter. But payments have been delayed for weeks and even months, keeping BP from discharging tankers on time. That boosted the price tag for the oil as BP was able to reprice some cargoes, and also charge PDVSA for keeping vessels offshore. It is the latest black eye for PDVSA, which is locked in a negative spiral where its declining exports and weakened balance sheet cause payments to suppliers to accumulate. Pending invoices to providers have piled up as the company races against the clock to refinance foreign bonds maturing in 2016 and 2017 to avoid a $3 billion payment due in the last quarter of this year. At the end of 2015, Venezuela’s PDVSA had $43.8 billion in consolidated financial debt. The cash crunch has hurt its ability to import diluents needed to formulate exportable crude grades and refined products to supply Venezuela’s domestic market. It has resorted to oil swaps to access imports. The total price tag for the BP tender rose 57 percent due to the delays to an average of $49 a barrel through August from the $31.21 planned in March, invoices and internal documents show. Under a purchase tender, two parties or more agree on a contract to supply specific crude types and volumes in a timeframe set by the importer. Because Venezuela needed the barrels, as the tankers piled up, PDVSA and BP agreed on new discharge windows. That allowed BP to take advantage of the rebound in crude prices and reprice the oil. As of mid August, PDVSA’s estimated total cost for the cargoes rose to $383 million, according to the documents. That also includes the cost of an additional 420,000 barrels requested later. Demurrage, or the cost of keeping a vessel at sea, is expected to add even more fees. Some 2.7 million barrels are currently stuck at sea around PDVSA’s terminal in Curacao for lack of pre-payment. PDVSA did not respond to requests for comments. BP declined to discuss commercial operations. The delays started with the very first cargo, which arrived in Curacao in April as planned, but paid by PDVSA two weeks later. Since then, waiting times for BP to receive the money transfers and authorize discharge have reached up to 70 days. In one internal communique, PDVSA acknowledged its cashflow woes were causing logistics problems. “Due to financial limitations, we have been unable to discharge the three last cargoes scheduled for April,” said a member of PDVSA’s trading team, in an internal letter from May seen by Reuters. The contract also said PDVSA would reimburse BP for any and all costs as a result of a suspension or termination of the contract in case of failed payment, including “storage, demurrage, resale and losses.” Since then, BP has claimed $770,000 in demurrage for the first two cargoes delivered and could do the same for 11 other cargoes that have faced delays. To help with the import costs, PDVSA turned to its unit in the United States, Citgo Petroleum, to pay two invoices to BP for a total of $43.7 million, according to bank transfer vouchers seen by Reuters. Citgo declined to comment. Even after the subsidiary intervened, the parent company said in an internal document on August 18 that it had a budget shortfall of $152 million. Many other communiques confirmed that PDVSA would be subject to prices higher than it originally anticipated due to delays. So far, nine cargoes carrying 4.77 million barrels have discharged at Bullenbay terminal in Curacao after being nearly entirely paid for, excluding demurrage costs. Out of 13 ordered cargoes in total, 4 are stuck at sea by payment delays. Though many risk-averse suppliers have shied away from PDVSA, BP structured a deal that - even with oil stuck at sea - allowed it to capture a recovery in prices. From early April through August, U.S. crude prices increased by 22 percent to $44.70 per barrel. The complex deal between the Venezuelan and British companies is far from over, according to a source from PDVSA’s commercial operations, as demurrage claims submitted to the Venezuelan state-run firm can take years to be resolved.

The acquisition of about 500,000 producing acres marks a turning point for BP since the Deepwater Horizon rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, for which the company is still paying off more than $65 billion in penalties and clean-up costs. “This is a transformational acquisition for our (onshore U.S.) business, a major step in delivering our upstream strategy and a world-class addition to BP’s distinctive portfolio,” BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley said in a statement. In a further sign of the upturn in its fortunes, BP said it would increase its quarterly dividend for the first time in nearly four years and announced a $6 billion share buyback, to be partly funded by selling some upstream assets. BP’s London-listed shares were trading 0.4 percent higher at 1400 GMT, compared with a 0.8 percent gain in the broader European energy index .SXEP. The sale ends a disastrous seven-year foray by BHP into shale on which the company effectively blew up $19 billion of shareholders’ funds. Investors led by U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management have been pressing the mining company to jettison the onshore assets for the past 18 months. BHP put the business up for sale last August. The sale price was better than the $8 billion to $10 billion that analysts had expected, and investors were pleased that BHP planned to return the proceeds to shareholders. “It was the wrong environment to have bought the assets when they did but this is the right market to have sold them in,” said Craig Evans, co-portfolio manager of the Tribeca Global Natural Resources Fund. BHP first acquired shale assets in 2011 for more than $20 billion with the takeover of Petrohawk Energy and shale gas interests from Chesapeake Energy Corp at the peak of the oil boom. It spent a further $20 billion developing the assets, but suffered as gas and oil prices collapsed, triggering massive writedowns. The world’s biggest miner said it would record a further one-off shale charge of about $2.8 billion post-tax in its 2018 financial year results. The deal, BP’s biggest since it bought oil company Atlantic Richfield Co in 1999, will increase its U.S. onshore oil and gas resources by 57 percent. BP will acquire BHP’s unit holding Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Permian Basin shale assets for $10.5 billion, giving it “some of the best acreage in some of the best basins in the onshore U.S.,” the company said. (For a graphic on U.S. oil production, click: tmsnrt.rs/2K1EjdY) Its bid beat rivals including Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N) for the assets, which have combined production of 190,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d)and 4.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent resources. The acquisition could push BP’s total U.S. production to 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) in two years and close to 1.4 million boe/d by 2025, said Maxim Petrov, a Wood Mackenzie analyst. “The Permian acreage offers the biggest longer-term upside, with some of the best breakevens in the play, well below $50 per barrel,” said Petrov. The deal would turn the onshore United States into “a heartland business in the company,” Bernard Looney, BP’s head of upstream, said in a call with analysts. It will bring BP into the oil-rich Permian basin in West Texas, where production has surged in recent years. With it, BP’s onshore oil production will jump from 10,000 barrels per day to 200,000 bpd by the mid-2020s, Looney said. BP said the transaction would boost its earnings and cash flow per share and it would still be able to maintain its gearing within a 20-30 percent range. The company also said it would increase its quarterly dividend by 2.5 percent to 10.25 cents a share, the first rise in 15 quarters. Meanwhile, a unit of Merit Energy Company will buy BHP Billiton Petroleum (Arkansas) Inc and the Fayetteville assets, for $0.3 billion. Tribeca’s Evans welcomed the clean exit for cash, rather than asset swaps which BHP had flagged as a possibility. “It leaves the company good scope to focus on their far better offshore oil business,” he said. BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie said the company had delivered on its promise to get value for its shale assets, while the sale was consistent with a long-term plan to simplify and strengthen its portfolio. BHP (BHP.AX) shares rose 2.3 percent after the announcement, outperforming the broader market and rival Rio Tinto (RIO.AX)(RIO.L). BP said it would pay the $10.5 billion in installments over six months from the date of completion, with $5.25 billion of the consideration to be raised through the sale of new shares.

Tesla will supply the 212 kilowatt (KW)/840 kilowatt hour battery at BP’s Titan 1 windfarm in South Dakota in the second half of this year. It operates 12 other windfarms in the United States. Providing large-scale battery power to windfarms allows them to store energy when wind is ample and make electricity available when demand is high, offering a crucial commercial advantage to an otherwise volatile energy source. “Lessons from the project will enable BP to make better informed decisions when evaluating and developing battery applications in the future,” BP said in a statement. “The project also supports BP’s broader strategy to invest half a billion dollars annually into low-carbon technologies, including projects within its established renewables portfolio as well as in new low-carbon businesses.” Several oil firms have already invested in battery technology. Norway’s Statoil plans to use a battery system, called Batwind, with its Hywind floating wind farm off the coast of Scotland. Vitol-owned VPI Immingham has developed a 50 megawatt, grid-connected battery portfolio in Britain.

Operating platforms remotely can be done with fewer staff than doing it offshore and other oil companies are also looking to do so to reduce production costs. Aker BP said Norway’s oil safety watchdog on Wednesday approved the company’s plans to switch controls at its Ivar Aasen oilfield in the North Sea. “It will be the first manned platform in Norway to be controlled from onshore,” Aker BP’s spokesman Ole-Johan Faret said in an email to Reuters. Norway’s largest oil and gas firm Equinor started remote operations of is Valemon field last year, but that platform only has workers on board periodically. Around 70 people work on Aker BP’s Ivar Aasen platform, 175 km (108 miles) off Norway’s west coast, including four control room operators. Aker BP said it expected to complete the switch of controls in the second quarter of 2019, and even after that it would keep some trained people on the platform who could take controls back if needed. “It’s a learning curve for us, so we will do that gradually to ensure safety,” Faret said. “Moving the control room onshore is a key part of Aker BP’s digitalization and improvement agenda,” Faret said. More generally, Aker BP is pushing ahead in digitising its assets and operations. Two years ago its top shareholder, Aker , set up software firm Cognite to do so because it could not find a suitable one. Cognite is now creating digital maps of Aker BP’s oil industry assets, integrating data from equipment such as pumps, heat and pressure sensors, maintenance records and even staff rotas to improve efficiency and safety. Sweden’s Lundin Petroleum, Aker BP’s partner in Ivar Aasen, has signed up to use the platform created by Cognite to share operational data from its installations offshore Norway. Last month, Equinor also started production at its Oseberg H platform, the first remotely operated fully unmanned wellhead platform on the Norwegian continental shelf. A spokeswoman for Norway’s oil safety watchdog said Equinor’s Martin Linge oil platform, scheduled to start in 2020, will be another remotely controlled platform offshore Norway. Equinor executives have previously said they expected future installations to be lighter, unmanned, robotized and remotely operated to keep development costs low.

The big picture: This is another sign of how big oil is slowly and gradually investing in lower-carbon technologies, alongside continued investments in oil and natural gas, driven by a series of overlapping factors, such as the notion of slowing oil demand and investor concern about climate change. Yes but: This is a drop in the bucket compared to BP's nearly $2 billion net profit it disclosed as its most recent quarterly earnings. BP's renewable-energy assets, which also include wind farms in the U.S. and biofuels in Brazil, aren't ""making a material difference to the bottom line,"" BP CEO Bob Dudley told an oil conference earlier this year.

80,2018-01-11 00:00:00,2018,1.0,11,Amy Harder,Scoop: BP CEO surprisingly cool to offshore drilling,"BP CEO Bob Dudley showed a muted appetite for pursuing drilling in new areas off America’s coasts in an exclusive interview with Axios this week. Why it matters: Dudley's comments throw cold water on the idea oil companies are going to jump on drilling new wells off America’s coasts in response to the Trump administration proposal to open up almost all federal waters to new leasing. The reality is more complicated — and less compelling — than top administration officials have made it seem as they pursue President Trump’s “energy dominance” agenda. BP has a unique portfolio that’s got Dudley cautious about drilling in new areas, including its continued response to its 2010 oil spill that nearly bankrupted the global oil producer and its already big presence in the Western Gulf of Mexico.  But Dudley’s caution is likely shared by other major oil companies, analysts say, for a few reasons: Continued low oil prices, relative to 2014.  Pressure by shareholders to continue keeping costs down even as oil prices have risen in recent days to three-year highs. Continued focus on onshore shale oil and natural gas, which offer cheaper, quicker ways to produce the fuel. Political, regulatory and litigation obstacles in new areas, such as off the coasts of Pacific and Atlantic states. Yes, but: Leasing is not the same as drilling. Companies may still bid for leases even if they have no immediate plans to drill, according to Kevin Book, managing director at independent research firm ClearView Energy Partners. The Interior Department plan released last week is for the years between 2019 and 2024, and a lot can change with oil prices and otherwise between now and then. Other relevant highlights from our exclusive interview with Dudley:  On BP’s interest in drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, which is now legally allowed after Republicans included a provision in the new tax law: “The honest answer is we don’t know … so we and I think most companies have got to have a good hard look in the geology over there.” On BP being in the group of companies that has drilled the only well ever in ANWR: “The results of that well are highly confidential, legally protected … Even I haven’t even seen that.” On drilling off the coast of Florida, which was in the original Interior Department plan before being abruptly removed after pressure from the state’s Republican governor, Rick Scott: “We would probably not drill within sight of the coast of Florida, most certainly.” ",https://www.axios.com/bp-ceo-on-new-offshore-drilling-meh-1515620383-d3941dcb-61d9-4f7f-8e19-867d746241c3.html,,Axios

82,2018-01-12 00:00:00,2018,1.0,12,Amy Harder,Scoop: BP CEO in Alaska talking natural-gas exports,"BP CEO Bob Dudley just visited Alaska to discuss with Gov. Bill Walker the producer’s potential involvement in a massive liquified natural gas export project there, Dudley told Axios in an exclusive interview this week.  Why it matters: BP’s consideration gives potential credence to the $43 billion proposed project, which coincided with President Trump visiting China in November and touting his administration’s backing of it. Many analysts doubt the proposal will actually come through, though, given a lack of details and firm commitments at the time of the announcement.  Driving the news: Dudley stopped in Washington this week on his way back to London from Alaska, where he met with Walker, who has been affiliated with both the Independent and Republican parties, and others to discuss BP taking part in the project. BP produces oil in the Prudhoe Bay region, whose natural gas resources could feed the proposed export terminal, Dudley said. Quoted: “It’s a large resource, and the world is going to need natural gas, particularly Asia,” Dudley said in an interview over lunch Tuesday in BP's Washington office. “We’re exploring with the state ways to make that resource find a market.”  Flashback: The state of Alaska, alongside Trump, announced in November a proposed deal where China’s biggest state-owned oil company, Sinopec, one of its top banks and sovereign wealth fund would invest billions of dollars to develop a pipeline and export terminal to export U.S. liquified natural gas (LNG) to Asia. Virtually all American LNG is exported from the U.S. Gulf Coast, and this project would make for a much shorter trip to Asia, a top export destination for American natural gas. For the record: A spokesman for Walker said the governor is “engaging with stakeholders across Alaska” to help bring the project to fruition. “I had not met the governor before,” Dudley told me. “I was impressed.” What else we’re hearing: In a separate interview, Charif Souki, considered a pioneer in the natural-gas exporting industry and founder of two companies in this space, expressed skepticism about the project. With a slight eye roll, Souki said: “it’s a very, very ambitious project.” Souki's company, Tellurian Inc., would be a likely competitor to the Alaskan export terminal.  Here's what else Souki, who decades earlier founded Cheniere Energy, said about the project in our December talk:  “It depends on a lot of moving parts. You have to source the gas, build the pipeline infrastructure and build the liquefaction facility. That’s three pieces controlled by three different groups of people.”  By the end of his comment, he sounded more optimistic: “It’s an attractive project.”  More from my interviews with Dudley and Souki BP CEO surprisingly cool to offshore drilling Q&A: Natural-gas executive Charif Souki Energy pioneer tries to surf the natural-gas wave",https://www.axios.com/scoop-bp-ceo-in-alaska-talking-natural-gas-exports-1515699909-91930233-1b17-43da-9fe6-0d32995d5db5.html,,Axios

The forecast is in its just-published 2018 Energy Outlook, a big collection of scenarios for global fuels, power and emissions trends through 2040. Bottom line: The ""evolving transition"" scenario sees growth in global demand for liquid fuels (largely a proxy for oil) ending in around 2035. More aggressive scenarios, including one that models global ban on sales of internal combustion (ICE) vehicles starting in 2040, show a more aggressive move away from oil, as the chart above shows. The ""evolving transitions"" case — which sees policies and tech evolving in a way consistent with the recent past — forecasts higher electric vehicles deployment than last year's report. ""In the ET scenario, there are nearly 190 million electric cars by 2035, higher than the base case in last year’s Outlook of 100 million. The stock of electric cars is projected to increase by a further 130 million in the subsequent five years, reaching around 320 million cars by 2040,"" they note. Yes, but: BP says even a ban on sale fossil fuel-powered cars in 2040 would not cause a collapse in oil demand, given the use of oil in petrochemical production, trucking and other sectors. ""This scenario reduces liquid fuel demand by around 10 million barrels a day relative to the Evolving Transition scenario but, even so, the level of oil demand in 2040 in the ‘ICE ban’ scenario is higher than in 2016,"" a summary states. They warn that major investments in new supply will be needed to meet demand in the decades ahead—the chart above includes their projection of what would happen absent finding and developing new fields.

London-based BP last year agreed to sell to North Sea oil producer Serica three fields including the Rhum field of which a subsidiary of Iran’s national oil company owns half. “Serica Energy plc announces that it has received notification from BP that the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) has issued a new license relating to the Rhum Field,” it said in a statement. “The license authorizes the provision of essential goods, services and support by certain U.S. persons and businesses to the Rhum field until 4 November 2018, replacing an existing authorization which expired on 30 September,” Serica said. “Discussions continue with OFAC regarding the conditions under which authorization may be given for the provision of goods, services and support to allow Rhum production to continue beyond 4 November.” The $400 million deal, which also covers the Bruce and Keith fields, is yet to complete pending a final U.S. decision on whether U.S. companies can be involved in running Rhum. The BP transaction would increase Serica’s production sevenfold to around 21,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which around 85 percent is gas. Rhum was shut down for most of the first half of the decade due to Western sanctions on Tehran. It resumed normal operations in 2016 following a nuclear deal between Iran and the world’s top powers. That accord is in danger of unraveling after U.S. President Donald Trump decided to impose fresh sanctions on Iran.

Why it matters: It’s one of the most significant developments showing how corporations are working with other world leaders on climate change amid President Trump’s whole-scale retreat on the issue. Situational awareness: One year ago today, Trump announced his intention to withdraw America from the Paris climate deal, which now has support from every country except the United States. Three years ago, Pope Francis wrote his encyclical — a papal letter sent to all bishops of the Roman Catholic Church — on the importance of addressing climate change, a first in the church’s history. Here’s a list of some of the participants in the private conference, with more expected: Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, world’s largest asset manager. Bob Dudley, CEO of BP. Darren Woods, CEO of ExxonMobil.  Eldar Sætre, CEO of Equinor, oil and energy producer partially owned by the Norwegian government (formerly Statoil). Ernest Moniz, former U.S. Energy Secretary under then-President Obama. Lord John Browne, former CEO of BP and current executive chairman of L1 Energy, an oil and gas investment firm. Ben Van Beurden, CEO of Royal Dutch Shell, was invited but declined because he had an obligation elsewhere, according to an official.  The big picture: The Pope, BlackRock and big oil companies are increasingly focusing on climate change as cleaner sources of energy have become more competitive, the impacts of a warmer world have become more apparent, and public pressure to address the issue mounts. This meeting reflects this convergence. The details: The focus of the gathering is similar to the encyclical (“On Care For Our Common Home”) with an emphasis on the energy transition of a “shared home,” according to people familiar with it. The event is occurring late next week, with two people saying the Pope is likely to talk Saturday. The University of Notre Dame is helping convene it. Leo Burke, director of its business school’s climate investing initiative, declined to comment. “All along the way, we have said that any energy-related meeting involving the Vatican and Notre Dame would be a private dialogue among the attendees,” Burke told me by email. Yes, but: While it’s a significant meeting, it’s still just a meeting. Deep political stalemate persists in the United States on the issue. Tensions are flaring over lawsuits alleging big oil companies are liable for climate change and some environmentalists say the industry’s greener moves aren’t big or fast enough. To what degree the Vatican gathering prompts change and new developments is a big question mark. For the record:  BP spokesman Geoff Morrell said Dudley is “looking forward to the Vatican dialogue. He believes gatherings of this kind help develop a better understanding of the energy transition and the best ways for corporations, countries and wider society to participate in it.”  An Exxon spokesman said the company is ""hopeful that this kind of dialogue can help develop solutions to the dual challenge of managing the risks of climate change while meeting growing demand for energy, which is critical to alleviating poverty and raising living standards in the developing world.""  A spokesman for Moniz confirmed his attendance. A BlackRock spokesperson declined to comment. A spokesperson for Equinor said the company looks forward to the ""opportunity to discuss how we can address climate change and opportunities in the energy transition.""

90,2018-06-04 00:00:00,2018,6.0,4,Amy Harder,"Exxon, BP, Shell teeter between enemy and ally in climate fight","The new flashpoint in the climate change debate is over the role of oil companies — whether they're culprits, allies, or something of a frenemy. Why it matters: The burning of fossil fuels these companies produce is a big reason Earth’s temperature is rising, yet their products are also foundations of the global economy. Whether you love or hate them, what role these companies play is inherent to addressing climate change, particularly in the absence of presidential leadership on the issue. Driving the news: Pope Francis is hosting a gathering later this week at the Vatican with executives of major oil producers and investment firms to talk about how the companies can address climate change, we reported exclusively Friday. It’s a significant and unusual meeting of a relatively progressive Pope with oil companies under pressure in two ways: Investors: Publicly traded oil and gas companies are facing growing pressure from shareholders to be more transparent about how policies cutting carbon emissions will impact their bottom lines. Lawsuits: The world’s five biggest publicly traded oil companies — ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, Shell and ConocoPhillips — are defendants in several lawsuits filed around the country by cities and states run by liberal politicians. The lawsuits allege the producers are liable for billions of dollars of damage caused by climate change. Royal Dutch Shell CEO Ben van Beurden told me recently he’s hoping for a truce, but doesn’t see it happening soon. Driven by several factors, some global oil companies are taking increasing steps toward investing in greener technologies and resources. Those efforts are doing little to influence many environmentalists, including Carroll Muffett, president of the Center for International Environmental Law in Washington, D.C., who says the moves are too little, too late and not a substitute for previous actions. “The relevant question isn't whether oil companies are dabbling in renewables again —but whether those investments reflect a fundamental shift in their business strategy. We see little sign of such a shift,” Muffett said. “Regardless, no amount of investment in renewables today will excuse the companies from responsibility for their past conduct and the climate crisis they helped create.” As for the Pope’s gathering, Muffett said he was reserving judgment. Another point made by critics: oil executives say they support putting a price on carbon emissions, but they're not actively lobbying Congress for it. Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, who has sponsored one of the only bills in the last few years putting a price on carbon, says oil companies aren’t being honest and are continuing to support trade associations that have traditionally opposed such policies. Those positions aren’t shared by others also working toward addressing climate change. Jason Grumet, president of the Bipartisan Policy Center, which gets funding both from oil companies including ExxonMobil and liberal foundations supporting the lawsuits, said ultimately what matters most is collaborating where possible. “The challenge is the scope and scale of the necessary low carbon energy transition,”  Grumet said. “While it is uncomfortable for many environmental advocates to accept, solving the problem with ExxonMobil is going to work much better than trying to do something to ExxonMobil.”  What to watch: Exxon, Shell and BP are among corporations backing an effort led by leaders of earlier Republican administrations to get Washington to back a plan pricing carbon emissions. The companies announced their support almost a year ago. The group, the Climate Leadership Council, hasn’t made any big public moves since then. Greg Bertelsen, a senior vice president with the group, said the companies, along with other founding members, meet quarterly. He signaled that some lawmakers could support the carbon policy, at least privately. “We’ve been encouraged by the reception that we and our founding member companies and other organizations have received on the Hill from both sides of the aisle,” Bertelsen said.

91,2018-06-13 00:00:00,2018,6.0,13,Ben Geman,"New BP report shows persistence of fossil fuels, uptick in global CO2 emissions","Global carbon dioxide emissions and coal consumption both rose in 2017, and the fuel mix in the electric power sector has changed little in 20 years, according to a newly released BP report on worldwide energy data. Why it matters: The findings underscore how, despite gains in low-carbon energy technologies, the world is nowhere near an emissions-cutting pathway that avoids highly dangerous levels of warming. Trend-spotting: The report shows a 1.6% rise in energy-related emissions — the overwhelming majority — and follows two other recent analyses showing an uptick in CO2 emissions after a three-year hiatus. The BP analysis also shows that global coal consumption ticked up slightly for the first time in four years, fueled by increases in India and — to a lesser extent — China. Improvements in an efficiency metric called energy intensity — that is, energy use per unit of economic output — have slowed. Overall global energy consumption grew by 2.2% in 2017, compared to 1.2% the prior year. The big picture: BP Chief Economist Spencer Dale cautioned against being ""too alarmed"" by what the data says about the global shift toward a lower-carbon energy system. He said that promising data in recent years stemmed partly from short-term cyclical factors, such as below-average GDP growth affected by weakness in energy-intensive industrial sectors. Yes, but: BP's summary of the report notes that the fuel mix in the worldwide electric power sector — which accounts for around 40% of global energy — is ""strikingly"" unchanged over the last two decades.  That is, the relative shares of coal vs. oil-and-gas- vs. non-fossil resources has not shifted greatly. While renewables generation been surging, its happening in the context of growing overall power demand growth that's almost entirely centered in emerging economies. Coal's share of the global power mix in 1998 was 38%, and in 2017 it was...38%. The share of non-fossil resources has actually decreased slightly compared to 20 years ago because the growth of renewables hasn't offset nuclear power's declining slice of the pie, Dale said. Quoted: Dale, in his speech, says he's more troubled by the persistence of this mix than the recent uptick in CO2 emissions. He called it ""striking"" in light of the major growth of renewables and policy efforts to shift from coal to cleaner fuels. ""To have any chance of getting on a path consistent with meeting the Paris climate goals, there will need to be significant improvements in the power sector,"" he said. One level deeper: Here's a few other takeaways from the annual report . . .  Natural gas consumption grew by 3%, thanks in part to surging Chinese demand, and oil consumption grew by 1.8%. Renewable power increased by 17%, with wind and solar accounting for the most of the growth.",https://www.axios.com/coal-renewable-energy-co2-emissions-bp-report-dbf2cacc-6151-4c28-81df-dc9900f0e913.html,,Axios

94,2018-07-27 00:00:00,2018,7.0,27,Ben Geman,BP bets big on U.S. shale,"BP is buying most of BHP Billiton's U.S. onshore holdings in a $10.5 billion deal that vastly bolsters its presence in the booming shale patch, where BP has previously had a limited portfolio. Why it matters: The deal ""transforms BP’s U.S. business"" and will immediately raise its U.S. production by nearly a fifth, with room to grow from there, Wood Mackenzie analyst Maxim Petrov said in a note Friday. It's BP's largest deal since buying Atlantic Richfield in 1999. By the numbers: BP is acquiring 470,000 acres spread across the Eagle Ford and Permian basins in Texas — which are major oil producing regions — and the gas-rich Haynesville basin in Texas and Louisiana. Those assets currently produce a combined total of 190,000 barrels worth of oil and gas per day, and contain 4.6 billion barrels of oil-equivalent resources, BP said. That represents a major addition to the company's existing onshore resource base of 8.1 billion barrels of oil-equivalent. The other side, per Reuters: ""The sale ends a disastrous seven-year foray by BHP into shale on which the company effectively blew up $19 billion of shareholders’ funds."" The big picture, via The Houston Chronicle: The deal ""represents a major turnaround for BP as it seeks to grow again after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon tragedy in the Gulf of Mexico."" The company said investors will see gains. BP also announced last night that it's increasing its second-quarter dividends by 2.5%. However, the company's stock is down slightly in pre-market trading. In addition to the BHP acreage acquisition, BP said that once the deal is complete, it's planning $5-6 billion in new divestments to fund share buybacks.

Why it matters: These companies, along with a few other big oil producers, have long said they support a tax on carbon emissions. Signing a letter — even though it’s still just a letter — is an early and important prerequisite that could likely lead to active lobbying Congress to support the bill.  One level deeper: The bill, which would replace the federal gas tax with a carbon tax, was introduced by GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Florida, with one fellow GOP co-sponsor, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania. A Curbelo spokeswoman declined to comment on the letter, expected to be released as soon as Wednesday.  Yes, but: The letter, which is expected to include a range of corporations, does not explicitly endorse the bill. Instead, it’s expected to broadly praise it and its role jumpstarting what’s been a long dormant substantive conversation on climate policy on Capitol Hill, according to people who have seen a copy of it or are familiar with it. Curbelo's legislation is symbolically important but has zero chance of passage in the foreseeable future, due to powerful GOP opposition to carbon taxes. For the record: Spokespeople for BP and Shell reiterated their support for a carbon tax, though they either declined or didn’t respond to requests for comments about the letter. An Equinor spokesperson confirmed the Norwegian company's participation early Wednesday.

99,2018-09-29 00:00:00,2018,9.0,29,Michael Sykes,Report: BP paid off Mexican government with $25 million after major oil spill,"Oil giant BP paid the Mexican government $25.5 million earlier this year to absolve the company of any responsibility for polluting Mexican waters after the Deepwater Horizon disaster in April 2010, Nathaniel Janowitz of BuzzFeed News reports after a two year investigation. Why it matters: The payout is relatively small considering BP spent a total of $60 billion in the aftermath of the spill and paid more than $10 billion to United States fishermen and businesses. None of the $25.5 million payment is going to Mexican citizens, Janowitz writes.  The payout was part of a confidential settlement dismissing a lawsuit related to the disaster, where an oil rig exploded and killed more than 11 workers releasing 4 million barrels of oil off the coast of Louisiana and into Mexico's waters.  The details: The Mexican government filed suit against BP, but dropped it five years later for the payout. More than $15 million has already been paid, but the country has never made a public announcement of the settlement or payments.  The agreement absolved BP of any responsibility for damages to Mexican waters, Janowitz writes. Mexico said it found no evidence of pollution caused by BP, ignoring research submitted by respected scientists of Mexico that the government spent millions on. The government also handed ""numerous lucrative energy contracts"" to BP, according to Janowitz, including five oil-drilling sites.  The impact: Janowitz writes of Tonalá, a town along the Gulf Coast where waters have been effected, that its river has been fished by families for generations, but activity has  reduced drastically. BP impacted their waters, but fishermen won't see a payment from them. And the company is in Mexico to stay, with thousands of BP gas stations on the way and already $200 million invested in oil blocks.

Why it matters: The funding amount in the Series A round was not disclosed, but it signals the interest in getting a stake in the world's largest market for EVs and its infrastructure. Of note: It's the first direct investment in China by BP Ventures, the company's VC arm. Details: BP's announcement says PowerShare's tech is a way to help manage the growing role of EV's in electricity infrastructure. ""PowerShare's cloud-based system also allows power suppliers to optimise their operations by continuously monitoring and balancing the power demand from vehicles with the supply capacity of the grid,"" it states.

Where it stands: BP touted the company's breakthroughs in seismic imaging and reservoir characterization, noting they revealed another 400 million barrels of oil. More broadly, the company said Tuesday that the same tech has identified another 1 billion barrels at a separate Gulf field called Thunder Horse. Why it matters: Energy tech is often discussed in terms of next-wave sources — advances in solar, batteries and so forth. But BP's discoveries show how tech is helping the industry find far more oil-and-gas in a more cost-effective way — even as BP and other majors expand their low-carbon portfolios.

In a related move, BP said progress on greenhouse gas cuts will factor into the pay of 36,000 employees, including executive directors. Why it matters: Friday's move is the latest sign of how some of the world's biggest fossil fuel producers are responding to pressure from advocates — including some large investors — on global warming. It comes 2 months after Royal Dutch Shell, after consultation with the same investor network called Climate Action 100+, agreed to set short-term carbon emissions goals for its products. Where it stands: BP supports a resolution from Climate Action 100+ to be adopted at BP's annual meeting later this year. Provisions include a call to show how billions of dollars of capital expenditures on oil-and-gas exploration and development, and investments in other technologies, are consistent with the Paris agreement. The resolution recognizes BP's prior moves on climate, including ""best in class"" management of methane, but says more is needed.

The existing production sharing deal was due to expire in 2024 and talks to extend it have been slow because of disagreements between partners in the BP-led consortium, sources told Reuters earlier this year. [nL8N19L42R] The extension of the Azeri contracts adds to the flurry of deals BP signed in recent weeks, including buying stakes in gas exploration areas off the coast of Mauritania and Senegal, and renewing an onshore oil concession in Abu Dhabi. [nL5N1EE253] BP said the consortium and Azeri state oil firm SOCAR on Friday signed a letter of intent to continue developing the giant Azeri-Chirag-Guneshly (ACG) offshore fields until 2050. It said it had agreed the key commercial terms for the future development while the deal was due to be finalised in the next few months. The shareholders in the consortium include BP, Chevron, INPEX, Statoil, ExxonMobil, TPAO, ITOCHU and ONGC Videsh. “ACG is known as the ‘Contract of the Century’. It is very important to Azerbaijan ... We can now look ahead to many more years of ACG’s success,” the statement quoted SOCAR’s president Rovnag Abdullayev as saying.

BP said the new deal will bring many thousands of jobs in the years ahead. BP came under fire from Azeri President Ilham Aliyev earlier this decade when the country’s leader criticized the oil firm for lower than promised output levels. With current output of 620,000 barrels per day, the fields have produced a total of over 3 billion barrels of oil since the start of the project, with around $33 billion of investment.

109,2018-06-29 00:00:00,2018,6.0,29,"Chen Aizhu, Florence Tan",BP holds millions of barrels of oil off China as demand falters,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Four supertankers chartered by energy major BP have been held up or delayed off China’s east coast over the last two months, unable to fully discharge oil as slowing demand from the country’s private refiners starts to impact global markets. Two of the four BP-chartered very large crude carriers (VLCCs) are still off Shandong province holding half their cargoes of Angolan crude oil, and another is headed back there from South Korea, according to trade flow data in Thomson Reuters Eikon and two shipping sources who track these vessels. It’s not clear why the tankers have had so much trouble offloading all their oil, or if BP had first secured buyers for the 8 million barrels - worth more than $600 million at current market prices - that was loaded onto the vessels out of Africa. BP has declined to comment on the matter. What is apparent is that the fortunes of China’s independent refiners, often called “teapots”, have turned for the worse amid escalating global trade tensions, rising crude oil prices, an oversupplied domestic fuel market and tighter government tax scrutiny. “Either it’s because of lower run rates curbing teapots’ buying, or the buyers are having problems paying,” said an executive with a western trading house. While an executive at an independent Shandong refiner said: “The market is bad - weak demand as plants come under policy headwinds ... (with) the tax rules biting into margins.” Both executives declined to be named as they were not authorized to speak publicly about commercial operations. (GRAPHIC: China diesel & gasoline exports - reut.rs/2yc8UF2) It is not unusual for producers like BP to ship cargoes before finding a buyer. But having cargoes orphaned for two months is less common, several oil traders and shippers said. Paying for supertankers, each half a kilometer (0.3 miles) long, to wait in open seas to unload is costly as well. Although it is not known at what rate BP chartered the four vessels, shippers estimate the daily charter rate for a VLCC is now about $30,000 a day. So, four chartered VLCCs sitting idle for a month would cost BP around $3.6 million. BP declined to comment on the cost of having the tankers waiting off China to unload oil. Several traders and shippers said BP was unlikely the only seller caught off guard by the slowdown in demand and the teapots’ troubles, although all said stranded cargoes of this size and duration is rare. Among the four BP-chartered ships, the Texas has been held up the longest. It discharged part of its Angolan crude load in mid-April at Qingdao and was slated to offload the rest of its cargo at Rizhao, another port in Shandong, shortly after. Instead, the Texas has been anchored off the coast until this week, when it discharged 130,000 tonnes on Thursday, according to a port source with knowledge of the matter. Another VLCC, the Olympic Light, has been floating near Qingdao after discharging part of its cargo on May 12, and may now be heading to the port to discharge the rest of its crude. The Mercury Hope, a third VLCC, has been looking for a home for its remaining cargo after it discharged part of it at Qingdao in late May. A fourth VLCC, Olympic Luck, planned to deliver crude to Qingdao in early May but turned away and transferred half of its cargo this week to a smaller tanker off Nagasaki, Japan, and then sailed toward South Korea. Now it has turned back and is heading toward Rizhao, still with oil onboard, according to shipping data on Eikon. The ship is scheduled to unload its cargo later on Friday, said Emma Li, an analyst with Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts. (MAP: Crude oil cargoes floating off China - reut.rs/2Iyv8ko) China’s teapot refiners, of which there are now almost 40, were only given oil import permits from 2015. They now make up a fifth of the 9 million barrels per day (bpd) taken by the world’s largest crude importer. BP, which produces some 2.5 million bpd globally including equity production in Angola, was one of the first western firms to sell into China’s booming independent oil market. It regularly ships West African oil to Shandong, the teapot hub. While most western majors market oil from offices in Singapore, BP has a China-based team of four traders, including staff hired away from state oil firms Sinochem [SASADA.UL] and China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) [SASACY.UL]. reut.rs/2tCSi4A (MAP: Tankers carry crude oil from West Africa to China - reut.rs/2N5blfZ) Reporting by Chen Aizhu in BEIJING and Florence Tan in SINGAPORE; Additional reporting by Meng Meng in BEIJING; Editing by Henning Gloystein and Tom Hogue",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-bp-oil-independents/bp-holds-millions-of-barrels-of-oil-off-china-as-demand-falters-idUSKBN1JP1DN,Commodities,Reuters

He had no further details. However, Mamadou Faye, director of Senegal’s state oil firm Petrosen, said no formal request had yet been made by the companies. “There is no substance to reports concerning Cairn’s assets in Senegal,” a Cairn spokesperson said. BP (BP.L) declined to comment. Cairn’s share price rose around 5 percent on Tuesday, BP’s was up around 1 percent. Oil majors have been increasingly homing in on the waters off Senegal, as well as neighbors Mauritania and Gambia, where they suspect hundreds of millions of barrels lie. A deal would further boost BP’s position in Senegal following a joint venture with Kosmos Energy in December last year, which revealed a major gas discovery in May. BP also has investments in two other offshore fields there. Senegal and Mauritania are two areas BP is targeting over the next decade and it plans to spend billions in the Tortue LNG project which is expected to produce its first gas in 2021. The deepwater SNE project is the first oil development in the West African nation. Cairn shares the project with Australia’s Woodside (WPL.AX) and FAR Ltd (FAR.AX). The companies expect to start producing by 2021. Woodside, Australia’s biggest independent oil and gas producer, bought a 35 percent stake from ConocoPhillips last year for up to $430 million, or $2.20 a barrel based on reserves of 561 million barrels at the time, before these were upgraded to nearly 650 million barrels. FAR Ltd has said the project could start producing before 2021, and at a higher rate than flagged before. Oil majors including Total SA and China’s CNOOC Ltd have also been investing in the waters off this part of the West African coast.

112,2016-07-26 00:00:00,2016,7.0,26,Karolin Schaps,British oil major BP pursues new projects despite profit miss,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP will forge ahead with at least three more new projects this year, its CEO said, despite the British oil major reporting a 45 percent drop in second-quarter earnings that prompted a cut in its 2016 investment budget to below $17 billion. Tuesday’s results missed expectations, with analysts surprised by higher corporate charges, including administrative costs relating to Gulf of Mexico oil spill liabilities, and a lower contribution from BP’s stake in Russian oil producer Rosneft. Rivals Shell, Statoil, Total and Eni also report second-quarter numbers this week, sharpening the focus on Tuesday’s drop in crude oil prices towards $44 a barrel, well short of the $60 previously cited as the level at which oil majors can break even. Though BP chief Bob Dudley acknowledged that the global oil glut’s impact on refining margins and revenue continues to make for a challenging environment, he said that capital expenditure plans have been helped by a drop in associated costs. “We’re going to choose our projects really carefully and the cost reductions and re-engineering of the projects has really brought them down to what I think is a very attractive (price range),” Dudley told Reuters. Dudley said that BP could make another three final investment decisions this year, having already signed off on the expansion of its Tangguh liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant in Indonesia and the Atoll offshore gas project in Egypt. A gas project in India, the second phase of the Mad Dog deepwater oil field in the Gulf of Mexico and a Trinidad project could all get the green light, he said. BP’s projects pipeline is expected to add 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day by the end of 2017, with a further 300,000 bpd by the end of the decade. Shares in the company fell 2.5 percent to 429 pence by 1128 GMT, but RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria said: “We think continued cost and capex deflation reads positively for the sector.” Second-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, BP’s most-watched profit measure, was $720 million, down from $1.3 billion in the same period last year and $120 million below an analyst consensus provided by the company. BP’s refining margins hit a six-year low for the second quarter and the company said they would remain under significant pressure in the coming months. It continues to reduce costs and now expects full-year capital expenditure to come in below the previous target of $17 billion target, saying that its 2017 investments could drop to as low as $15 billion if crude prices remain weak. “I don’t think BP should go below that because then you start to take away from important growth,” Dudley said. Total costs for the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill, which killed 11 workers, has reached $62 billion but the majority of claims have now been settled. BP maintained its quarterly dividend at 10 cents a share, reassuring investors in a sector valued for its consistent payouts.

The British energy company sold a cargo of Russian Urals crude to Samir in August 2014 which was not paid for and NBAD took on 95 percent of that debt. The London High Court ruled that BP did not have the right to pass on the debt. It said the contract between BP and Samir stipulated that there could be no assignment of obligations or rights without reasonable consent and that Samir’s consent had not been obtained. It said NBAD was entitled to claim from BP some $68.9 million plus interest that Samir failed to pay the bank. BP declined to comment on the judgement. Trading and oil companies such as Glencore, Vitol and BB Energy are collectively owed around $1 billion by Samir. Efforts to restart the refinery have so far failed. Liquidator Mohamed el-Krimi said on Monday that he would only consider bids to buy the Samir refinery that included a production restart. The 200,000 barrel per day plant was shut in August 2015 due to financial difficulties after the government said Samir owed over $1.3 billion in taxes. Industry sources have criticised that move, noting it reduces the plant’s value and necessitates a restart that could take several months. After Samir failed to buy crude in the market earlier this year, a processing agreement, whereby traders provide crude in exchange for the refined output, was considered as a way to pay back money owed. Those negotiations have also failed to produce a deal. Reporting by Julia Payne; editing by Jason Neely",http://www.reuters.com/article/morocco-samir-bp-idUSL8N1DO2GW,Intel,Reuters

But experts know that is very wrong. In fact, according to the CDC, heart disease is the number one cause of death for women in the U.S. And, just a few months after Carrie Fisher's tragic death, we're more aware than ever of the need for women to keep an eye on their heart health — including their blood pressure. And don't think that just because you're young you're immune to high blood pressure: a 2011 study funded by the National Institutes of Health found that nearly one in five people between the ages of 24 and 32 had high blood pressure. Luckily, a few basic lifestyle practices can help you lower it or keep it where it needs to be. The cutoff for a healthy blood pressure reading is the same for men and women: You want to be below 120 systolic and below 80 diastolic, so a reading below 120/80 is considered healthy. If either number gets higher than that, your doctor will talk to you about adopting some healthier lifestyle habits and, possibly, taking medication to lower your blood pressure. So what might those lifestyle changes involve? According to the American Heart Association (AHA), the most important lifestyle factors for heart health are your diet and your activity level. In terms of nutrition, you should be sticking with lots of fruits and veggies, whole grains, lean meats, nuts, and legumes. But you should avoid too much red meat, sugary drinks, and foods that are especially high in sodium or saturated and trans fats. That also means keeping your alcohol consumption in check as much as possible. Unfortunately, the CDC recommends that women have no more than one drink per day (including ""heart healthy"" red wine). Although there may be some wiggle room there, you'll have to talk to your doctor to find out how much there is for you — if you're trying to keep your blood pressure under control, it may be especially important that you stay within those strict guidelines. When it comes to exercising, the AHA recommends healthy adults get a total of two hours and 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity every week. If you're trying to lower your blood pressure, it suggests working out in 40-minute chunks three or four times per week. What does ""moderate"" mean? You should be working at a level where you're still able to speak in short sentences, but you can't have a full conversation with your workout buddy. If you find yourself getting into full Gossip Mode, you're probably not working hard enough. All of this will also help you maintain a healthy weight, another factor in your risk for heart disease. But, if you're concerned about your blood pressure, the best thing to do is check in with your doctor. She can talk you through all the different factors that affect your heart health and help you come up with a reasonable plan to keep your ticker ticking along.",https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-lower-blood-pressure-normal-for-women,,Refinery 29

The European Commission failed to prove that the Belgian tax break constituted aid, said the ruling by the General Court, the lower branch of the Court of Justice in Luxembourg. “The Commission wrongly considered that the Belgian system relating to the excess profit of multinational companies constituted an aid scheme,” it said. The ruling marks a setback for the EU’s crackdown on tax avoidance by multinationals, a drive led by Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager. The European Commission in 2016 had ordered Belgium to recover some 700 million euros ($789 million) from companies which benefited from the scheme. In addition to BP and BASF, Wabco, Cellio, Atlas Copco and Belgacom (now Proximus) benefited from the tax break. Belgium and U.S. manufacturer Magnetrol had challenged the Commission in cases filed with the General Court. It’s possible that the Commission will now pursue individual cases in the Belgian tax break case, according to one lawyer. “The Commission can take a new decision qualifying each individual case,” said Jacques Derenne, a partner at law firm Sheppard Mullin. Elsewhere the European Commission’s crackdown on large companies avoiding tax has seen it order Ireland to recover some 13 billion euros from iPhone maker Apple. Luxembourg was instructed to claw back 250 million euros from Amazon, about 120 million euros from France’s Engie and up to 30 million euros from Fiat Chrysler.

The leading euro zone stocks index was up 0.4 percent by 0829 GMT, while Germany’s DAX rose 0.3 percent and Britain’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.4 percent. U.S. stocks were hit by a report the United States plans to impose tariffs on all Chinese imports if no progress is made at talks between President Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. But risk appetite came back slightly in Asian and early European trading after Trump said he expects a “great deal” with China and Beijing made a fresh attempt to stabilise the country’s stock markets. Strong earnings from BP and Volkswagen helped cement the gains. Trading was still laced with anxiety, though, after the past fortnight saw heavy losses across stock markets leaving the pan-European STOXX 600 near a 22-month low. A beneficiary of higher crude costs, BP jumped 4.3 percent after the oil major’s profits soared to a five-year high. Its gains boosted the oil & gas sector index up 1.3 percent, helping lift the market. Volkswagen topped the DAX with a 4.6 percent gain after the carmaker’s profit topped forecasts - bucking the trend in the autos sector hurt by slower car sales and more stringent anti-emissions regulations. Autos & parts stocks led gains for a second day, up 1.5 percent. Several earnings disappointments weighed, with companies continuing to flag cost pressures and difficulties in the construction sector. Geberit shares were the worst-performing, falling 9.1 percent after the Swiss plumbing supplies provider cut its sales outlook and said it was more cautious about the building industry. Lufthansa shares tumbled 5.1 percent after the German airline missed profit estimates for the third quarter and said it would raise its number of flights more modestly than peers this season. Bank stocks were also a weak spot.

118,2018-07-26 00:00:00,2018,7.0,26,"Sonali Paul, Ron Bousso",BP pays $10.5 billion for BHP shale assets to beef up U.S. business,"MELBOURNE/LONDON (Reuters) - BP Plc (BP.L) has agreed to buy U.S. shale oil and gas assets from global miner BHP Billiton BLT.L (BHP.AX) for $10.5 billion, expanding the British oil major’s footprint in some of the nation’s most productive oil basins in its biggest deal in nearly 20 years. The acquisition of about 500,000 producing acres marks a turning point for BP since the Deepwater Horizon rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, for which the company is still paying off more than $65 billion in penalties and clean-up costs. “This is a transformational acquisition for our (onshore U.S.) business, a major step in delivering our upstream strategy and a world-class addition to BP’s distinctive portfolio,” BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley said in a statement. In a further sign of the upturn in its fortunes, BP said it would increase its quarterly dividend for the first time in nearly four years and announced a $6 billion share buyback, to be partly funded by selling some upstream assets. BP’s London-listed shares were trading 0.4 percent higher at 1400 GMT, compared with a 0.8 percent gain in the broader European energy index .SXEP. The sale ends a disastrous seven-year foray by BHP into shale on which the company effectively blew up $19 billion of shareholders’ funds. Investors led by U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management have been pressing the mining company to jettison the onshore assets for the past 18 months. BHP put the business up for sale last August. The sale price was better than the $8 billion to $10 billion that analysts had expected, and investors were pleased that BHP planned to return the proceeds to shareholders. “It was the wrong environment to have bought the assets when they did but this is the right market to have sold them in,” said Craig Evans, co-portfolio manager of the Tribeca Global Natural Resources Fund. BHP first acquired shale assets in 2011 for more than $20 billion with the takeover of Petrohawk Energy and shale gas interests from Chesapeake Energy Corp at the peak of the oil boom. It spent a further $20 billion developing the assets, but suffered as gas and oil prices collapsed, triggering massive writedowns. The world’s biggest miner said it would record a further one-off shale charge of about $2.8 billion post-tax in its 2018 financial year results. The deal, BP’s biggest since it bought oil company Atlantic Richfield Co in 1999, will increase its U.S. onshore oil and gas resources by 57 percent. BP will acquire BHP’s unit holding Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Permian Basin shale assets for $10.5 billion, giving it “some of the best acreage in some of the best basins in the onshore U.S.,” the company said. (For a graphic on U.S. oil production, click: tmsnrt.rs/2K1EjdY) Its bid beat rivals including Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N) for the assets, which have combined production of 190,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d)and 4.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent resources. The acquisition could push BP’s total U.S. production to 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) in two years and close to 1.4 million boe/d by 2025, said Maxim Petrov, a Wood Mackenzie analyst. “The Permian acreage offers the biggest longer-term upside, with some of the best breakevens in the play, well below $50 per barrel,” said Petrov. The deal would turn the onshore United States into “a heartland business in the company,” Bernard Looney, BP’s head of upstream, said in a call with analysts. It will bring BP into the oil-rich Permian basin in West Texas, where production has surged in recent years. With it, BP’s onshore oil production will jump from 10,000 barrels per day to 200,000 bpd by the mid-2020s, Looney said. BP said the transaction would boost its earnings and cash flow per share and it would still be able to maintain its gearing within a 20-30 percent range. The company also said it would increase its quarterly dividend by 2.5 percent to 10.25 cents a share, the first rise in 15 quarters. Meanwhile, a unit of Merit Energy Company will buy BHP Billiton Petroleum (Arkansas) Inc and the Fayetteville assets, for $0.3 billion. Tribeca’s Evans welcomed the clean exit for cash, rather than asset swaps which BHP had flagged as a possibility. “It leaves the company good scope to focus on their far better offshore oil business,” he said. BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie said the company had delivered on its promise to get value for its shale assets, while the sale was consistent with a long-term plan to simplify and strengthen its portfolio. BHP (BHP.AX) shares rose 2.3 percent after the announcement, outperforming the broader market and rival Rio Tinto (RIO.AX)(RIO.L). BP said it would pay the $10.5 billion in installments over six months from the date of completion, with $5.25 billion of the consideration to be raised through the sale of new shares.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.3 percent to its highest since Dec. 3, while euro zone stocks added 1.5 percent. The commodity-heavy FTSE 100 rose 2 percent as a falling pound gave an accounting boost to blue chips with strong revenues outside Britain. Upbeat results on Wall Street also helped fuel optimism ahead of the State of the Union address by President Donald Trump. “I feel that markets in general are looking for a reason to move up”, said James Bateman, chief investment officer at Fidelity International. “We had the period of panic and thinking about the risk of trade wars, and markets are now desperately latching onto any source of optimism they can”, he added. BP said its profit doubled to $12.7 billion in 2018, driven by strong growth in oil and gas output following the acquisition of a large portfolio of U.S. shale assets. “This is the eighth quarter in a row that BP have beaten street expectations. Surely that’s enough to convince ‘Mr Market’ that something has changed inside BP,” Bernstein analyst Oswald Clint said. “It’s all down to unheard-of upstream project execution and faster than we expected downstream new site roll-out,” he added, confirming his outperform rating on the stock. BP shares rose 5.1 percent, their best day since September 2016. The oil index helped lift the market with a 1.7 percent rise. Euro zone banks, which have been under pressure due to concerns over a slowing economy and dovish central bank stances, recovered after six straight session of losses, rising 1.7 percent. Top faller on the STOXX 600 was AMS, down 6.9 percent after the sensor specialist and Apple supplier skipped its dividend and said first-quarter revenue would fall amid continued weak smartphone demand. In the same sector, Infineon managed to avoid heavy losses despite a disappointing update, suggesting recent price falls may have priced in the worsening outlook for the sector. Its shares were down 0.6 percent. The firm forecast full-year revenue growth to the bottom of its earlier range, as the maker of high-performance power chips blamed increasingly difficult business conditions. “While the lowering of guidance is somewhat disappointing, the new growth expectation of 9 percent is still very healthy in the current environment,” said Liberum analyst Janardan Menon. “Any weakness in the share price represents a buying opportunity in our opinion,” he added.

121,2016-04-14 00:00:00,2016,4.0,14,"Ron Bousso, Karolin Schaps","BP investors say ""no"" to CEO Dudley's $20 million pay deal","LONDON (Reuters) - BP’s shareholders have voted against Chief Executive Bob Dudley’s $20 million pay deal for 2015, a rare investor revolt for such a major company, after it recorded a record annual loss. Some 59 percent of shareholders on Thursday opposed the pay and benefits package, according to preliminary figures, in stark contrast with previous years when over 80 percent and sometimes as many as 90 percent voted in favor of the pay packages for senior executives. Investors gathered at the ExCel exhibition center in east London gasped when the initial voting figures were displayed on screen in the hall during the company’s annual meeting. BP’s stock was down 1.3 percent at 1450 GMT, underperforming most rivals and the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares. Dudley’s 2015 pay and benefits rose 20 percent even though the company cut 5,000 jobs last year and reported steep losses after oil prices plunged. While rival Royal Dutch Shell stayed in the black last year, its chief executive, Ben van Beurden, saw his pay fall to 5.6 million euros ($6.3 million) from 24.2 million euros. Even though the vote was non-binding, BP executives said they would consider making changes to the way remuneration is calculated in future. “We will ... review the overall remuneration package,” Ann Dowling, head of BP’s remuneration committee, told shareholders at the meeting. “I will report on this next year with our conclusions and with a new proposed policy based on the outcome of this review.” The review will include assessing how the remuneration committee deals with oil price fluctuations and will engage directly with major shareholders. BP had long argued that management rewards should be based on a combination of factors including cash generation and operational performance. Last year Dudley clinched a final settlement with U.S. authorities over the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil disaster, which many investors said removed uncertainty around the firm’s future but also led to a big provision, pushing the company into the red. Britain’s biggest mutual life and pensions fund, Royal London Asset Management, and two shareholder advisers, Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, had all recommended rejecting Dudley’s pay. “The 59.1 percent vote against the executive directors remuneration is extraordinary and shows a lack of discretion by BP’s board,” said Ashley Hamilton Claxton, corporate governance manager at Royal London. Top 10 investor Legal & General Investment Management said it voted against the remuneration package as the company “should have used discretion to scale back bonus payments and long-term incentive awards to executive directors” during the year. “We welcome the Chairman’s speech to meet leading investors and we will continue to engage with BP to develop a policy better aligned to long term shareholder returns,” LGIM said in a statement. BP said last month that executive directors received no increase in base salary in 2015 and that the senior leadership would not see salary increases this year either. However, Dudley’s total pay was boosted by a payment to his U.S. pension scheme and deferred bonus payments. The shareholder vote is rare but not unprecedented. In 2012 a majority of shareholders at two British companies, WPP and Aviva, voted against proposed pay deals for executives in what the media become known as the “Shareholder Spring”. Aviva Chief Executive Andrew Moss left the insurer a few days later, but WPP’s long-serving CEO Martin Sorrell is still at the helm of the advertising group. In Germany Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) top management board has agreed to cut executives’ bonus payments by at least 30 percent, a source said this week, as the troubled carmaker struggles to resolve a dispute over management pay in the wake of the emissions scandal.. BP had earlier struck a cautious tone on dividend payments, one of the main attractions for investors in energy firms but harder to justify in an era of lower commodity prices. BP told investors it aimed to maintain dividends but could review the payout policy if oil prices remained lower for longer. BP, which had long said dividends were an absolute priority, said that although its goal was to maintain dividends, it “must” at the same time secure its future by investing wisely. “Be assured that we keep this balance under regular review. Should the oil price remain lower, longer than expected, we will need to revisit our financial framework,” BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said. Last year Italy’s ENI was the first major oil company to cut dividends.

The London-listed company saw one of the strongest output increases in its history last year, lifting production to levels not seen since the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill. Production is set to continue growing into the end of the decade thanks to more field start-ups this year. BP would generate profits in 2018 at an oil price of $50 a barrel, Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary told Reuters, as years of spending cuts kicked in and as it slowly shakes off a $65 billion bill for penalties and clean-up costs of the 2010 spill. BP was the first among its European peers to resume share buybacks in the fourth quarter of 2017 after years dilutive austerity measures in the face of the industry slump. With a 20 percent bounce in oil prices in the last quarter of 2017 to $61 a barrel, BP had a surplus of cash that allowed it to buy $343 million worth of shares in the fourth quarter, offsetting the scrip dilution. BP shares were trading 0.7 percent lower at 1340 GMT, compared with a 2.6 percent decline for the sector. “2017 was one of the strongest years in BP’s recent history,” Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said in a statement. Full-year production rose 12 percent to 2.47 million barrels per day (bpd) after BP launched seven new oil and gas fields in 2017, a record year. It is set to start up six additional projects this year including in Egypt, Azerbaijan and Britain’s North Sea, helping boost production by 900,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021, most of it gas. It previously said it would launch five new projects this year. Production from its U.S. shale business, which BP aims to increase into the next decade, was profitable for the first time in many years, BP head of upstream Bernard Looney said in an analysts conference. BP was added about 1 billion of barrels of oil equivalent to its reserves in 2017, the largest since 2004, thanks to six discoveries, including in Senegal and the North Sea. Its reserve replacement ratio was estimated at 143 percent for the year. BP’s refining and trading business, known as downstream, saw profits rise to $7 billion in 2017 as earnings for the marketing division rose by more than 10 percent. “The operational performance from BP is encouraging and we expect momentum to build into 2018,” Barclays analysts said in a note. Cash flow in the fourth quarter rose slightly to $6.2 billion but fell short of market expectations, raising concerns that cost cuts have run their course, echoing concerns about rivals Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil and Chevron which reported last week. Payments for the Deepwater Horizon spill continued to weigh on BP, which took a $1.7 billion charge in the quarter due to higher-than-expected claims settlements, bringing the total legal and clean-up costs to $65 billion. BP also took a one-off charge of $900 million to adjust to new U.S. tax rules, but Dudley said BP will invest more in the United States as a result. Despite the strong start to oil prices, which reached a three-year high in January, Gilvary said he expected prices to come down to $50-$55 a barrel by the end of this year. BP reported a $2.1 billion fourth-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, the company’s definition of net income, topping forecasts for $1.9 billion, a company-provided survey of analysts showed. That marked a jump from $400 million a year earlier and topped a third-quarter profit of $1.9 billion. On an annual basis, BP’s profits soared to $6.2 billion from $2.6 billion in 2016. Gearing, the ratio between debt and BP’s market value, rose to 27.4 percent at the end of 2017 from 26.8 percent at the end of 2016. Net debt was $37.8 billion, up from $35.5 billion a year earlier, after the company paid $5.4 billion related to the Deepwater Horizon spill. BP’s full-year capital spending reached $16.5 billion, within the annual range of $15-$17 billion it plans to maintain until 2021.

123,2017-09-14 00:00:00,2017,9.0,14,"Nailia Bagirova, Ron Bousso",BP-led group extends Azeri oil 'contract of the century',"BAKU/LONDON (Reuters) - BP and Azerbaijan agreed on Thursday to extend into 2050 a contract to develop the ex-Soviet state’s biggest oilfield cluster, a deal dubbed “the contract of the century” when first signed in 1994. Under the new production sharing agreement, the Azeri state energy company SOCAR will increase its share to 25 percent from 11.65 percent, while BP’s stake declines to 30.37 percent from 35.8 percent. BP will remain the operator. The new contract secures large investment in Azerbaijan’s oil sector for decades and a one-off bonus of $3.6 billion for the government, a welcome boost to a nation that has struggled with a sharp drop in oil prices in the past three years. “This bonus will be paid to Azerbaijan in eight tranches in the next eight years after an agreement is ratified by Azerbaijan’s parliament,” a source at SOCAR told Reuters. The 1994 agreement to develop the giant Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) fields in the Caspian Sea was transformative for Baku’s political and economic development after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The new deal, whose exact terms were not disclosed, remains profitable for its partners at current oil prices of $55 a barrel, BP Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said in an interview. The fields produce 585,000 barrels per day, accounting for three quarters of the Azerbaijan’s oil output, but production is expected to rise as the partners could invest up to $40 billion in the next 32 years, according to a statement. “There are still billions of barrels to recover and billions of dollars to invest” in the project, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Laura Bennie. “Attention will now turn to a brand-new production platform (Azeri Central East), which will be commissioned in the 2020s,” she said. Azeri President Ilham Aliyev said the remaining oil reserves of the ACG oilfields stood at 500 million tonnes. Stakes of other firms in the consortium have also been reduced. Chevron now has 9.57 percent, Inpex 9.31 percent, Statoil 7.27 percent, ExxonMobil 6.79 percent, TPAO 5.73 percent, Itochu 3.65 percent and ONGC Videsh 2.31 percent.

BP Ventures, BP’s investment arm, led the round, putting in $10 million, whilst the London headquartered startup says it plans to use the additional capital to develop a “new transactional B2B marketplace,” moving beyond its current B2C offering. Specifically, the new B2B proposition promises to connect suppliers, re-sellers (brokers) and other service providers. This will see Victor partner with other flight-planning and aviation fuel providers, in addition to a commercial agreement it has with Air BP to become the preferred fuel supplier for the charters it arranges at Air BP locations. “By creating a ‘full spectrum’ digital ecosystem, further underpinned by several pivotal ‘granted’ U.S. patents, Victor hopes to establish itself as a ‘next generation’ provider of services to the general aviation industry and beyond,” says the company. It also plans to adds new geographical territories to its B2B private jet charter marketplace. Meanwhile, I’m told that Victor — which, along with London has offices in New York and California — hit its sales revenue forecast of $39 million for 2016 and says it is on target in 2017 for a full year of over $60 million.

125,2017-07-18 00:00:00,2017,7.0,18,Jessica Resnick-Ault,BP mulling IPO of U.S. Midwest and Gulf Coast pipeline assets,"(Reuters) - BP Plc (BP.L) is considering an initial public offering of its vast U.S. Midwest and Gulf Coast pipeline assets, the company said on Tuesday, a move that would raise cash. The proposed spinoff, which would be called BP Midstream Partners, revives a plan first broached internally about five years ago before slumping crude oil prices caused the company to put the idea on hold, a person familiar with the proposal said. BP’s plan would spin off crude oil, natural gas and fuel pipelines in a master-limited partnership (MLP), a tax-advantaged structure often used by pipeline and other capital intensive companies. If it decides to go ahead with the idea, BP said it would register the subsidiary by year-end. The company and its underwriters have retained advisors to explore the sale, the source said. A spinoff likely would be one of the larger initial public offerings of the year, the person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity as the talks were private. BP did not comment on the details or potential valuation of a possible transaction beyond the press release. It would own the MLP’s general partner and receive all of its distribution rights, the statement said. Several other energy companies have spun off their pipeline assets to generate capital. They include rival Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L), which in 2014 raised nearly $1 billion in the largest MLP IPO to date, along with refiners like Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N), Tesoro Corp TSO.N, and Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N). Shell was the first oil major to use this structure to generate cash from its assets. Shell’s partnership has a market value of about $5.38 billion. BP’s pipeline network is slightly smaller than Shell’s. Previous efforts by BP to sell pipeline assets have not materialized. Last year, BP approached Enbridge Inc (ENB.TO) to sell some of BP’s offshore Gulf of Mexico pipeline network, but the deal fell through, according to a person familiar with that transaction. BP’s U.S. pipeline business includes a network of 3,500 miles (5,633 kilometers) of pipelines and terminal facilities that transport and store more than 1.3 million barrels per day of oil, refined products and natural gas. In addition to the Gulf Coast and Midwest assets, BP operates pipelines in the Pacific Northwest. Under U.S. tax codes, MLPs are partnerships that do not pay corporate income tax on distributions, or earnings, to partners. The partners, or owners, are responsible for paying taxes on the distributions. BP’s potential IPO of its midstream assets comes at a rough time for the U.S. pipeline sector. While pipeline operators derive profit from long-term contracts not linked to commodity price gyrations, the dip in oil prices in recent years has nonetheless weighed on the sector, said Tamar Essner, director of energy and utilities at Nasdaq Corporate Solutions. “There’s this perception in the market that the midstream sector is meant to be insulated from the volatility of the commodity price movement,” said Essner. “But retail investors have gotten spooked by oil markets.” The price of crude oil has fallen sharply in recent months, with oil overall down nearly 14 percent this year. The Alerian MLP exchange-traded fund (AMLP.K), which tracks the performance of more than two dozen midstream companies, has lost more than 4 percent in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters data. Tuesday’s announcement came after the market closed. BP is worth 88 billion GBP ($114.8 billion) and its shares closed on Tuesday in London at 445.80 GBP a share. BP is still paying down costs from the deadly 2010 Deepwater Horizon rig explosion at its Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The company is set to pay up to $5.5 billion in cash payments to U.S. authorities this year as part of one settlement. BP has sharply reduced its capital spending over the past three years in the face of a drop in oil prices, but it still requires an oil price of around $60 a barrel in order to cover its costs, dividends and penalties. The lesson for BP from Shell’s experience is a master limited partnership drawing on existing assets can allow it to get cash and continuing income from its capital-intensive operations while still working closely with the asset owners. “We prioritize our assets and maintain strategic control,” said John Hollowell, chief executive of Shell Midstream Partners in an interview last month referring only to Shell’s decision-making. “The key part for us is allows to have the best of both worlds. We can monetize and maintain control of the asset.” Reporting By Jessica Resnick Ault in New York, Gary McWilliams and Ernest Scheyder in Houston and Ron Bousso in London; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and David Gregorio",https://www.reuters.com/article/bp-ipo-pipeline-idUSL1N1K91U6,Deals,Reuters
126,2016-04-26 00:00:00,2016,4.0,26,,"Britain's FTSE rises, boosted by BP and Standard Chartered","* FTSE up 0.4 pct at close * Standard Chartered surges after results * BP rises as results beat forecasts despite profit slump * Cobham dives after rights issue, profit warning (Updates prices at close) By Kit Rees and Sudip Kar-Gupta LONDON, April 26 (Reuters) - Britain’s top share index climbed on Tuesday with Standard Chartered and BP both rising sharply after reporting earnings that reassured investors. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index closed 0.4 percent higher at 6,284.52 points, slightly below a 4-month high reached last week, with BP’s 4.3 percent rise adding the most points. The energy group posted an 80 percent drop in first quarter profits but still beat analysts’ expectations. It maintained its dividend and said it could cut capital spending further. “Overall, it’s a good set of figures as it looks like BP is getting costs under control,” said Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital. The banking group Standard Chartered surged over 9 percent after its profit rebounded in the first quarter, as reduced loan losses offered signs of a turnaround following a loss-making 2015. The stock led the UK banking index higher, which rose 3 percent. “Q1 results ... show the group has moved back into profit on both underlying and reported bases, reflecting a sharp reduction in impairments compared to the final quarter of last year,” said Gary Greenwood, analyst at Shore Capital. But he also added a note of caution on the bank’s outlook: “We believe the road to recovery is a long one and that the shares are likely to remain highly volatile in the near term. We therefore retain a neutral stance.” Shares in Whitbread, which runs Premier Inn hotels and the Costa Coffee chain, rose 2.6 percent after reporting a rise in profits. Engineering firm Cobham, which is on the FTSE 250 mid-cap index, slumped 17.5 percent after proposing a 500 million pound ($725 million) rights issue to strengthen its balance sheet after issuing a profit warning. “As earnings have been essentially static for some time, it is unlikely that the market will rehabilitate a better financed Cobham until true organic growth is demonstrated by the company,” Andy Chambers, analyst at Edison Investment Research, said in a note. The FTSE 100 is up around 0.7 percent so far in 2016, but nearly 12 percent below a record high reached in April 2015.

127,2018-07-27 00:00:00,2018,7.0,27,George Hay,Breakingviews - BP takes worthwhile gamble with shale deal,"LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - BP is bucking the trend. Oil investors nowadays are sceptical of pricey deals that double down on hydrocarbons. The UK oil major’s $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP’s U.S. shale assets, announced on Friday, superficially ticks those problematic boxes, but is still worthwhile. On the face of it, BP is paying up. The price is just above the $8 billion to $10 billion range that analysts had estimated assets in the Permian, Eagle Ford and Haynesville basins of Texas were worth. And the implied value of the land is around $22,000 per acre, above the $18,632 average for recent Permian transactions, as calculated by broker Raymond James. Still, Concho Resources offered more than $100,000 per acre in March for RSP Permian. And BP reckons it can achieve $350 million in annual synergies given it already owns oil and gas fields in the region. Taxed at 30 percent and capitalised, these are worth $2.5 billion. That implies BP is paying $8 billion, or $17,000 per acre. Moreover, the company thinks the $10.5 billion price tag can be achieved by discounting the assets’ future value at 10 percent and assuming an oil price of $55 a barrel. As long as crude values hover above $70 a barrel, the price looks cheaper. BP investors have two other reasons to feel sanguine. First, the company has been underexposed to the hottest market in global oil since the sale of its U.S. shale assets in 2010. Adding the equivalent of 190,000 barrels of oil per day to production may seem small beer against 2017 annual output of 3.6 million barrels per day. But shale production cycles are much shorter than those of traditional oil projects, so these assets are more likely to be exploited before oil demand peaks. Second, BP’s balance sheet is healthy enough to take the strain. While it will use cash reserves to pay half of the $10.5 billion, it could well generate $5 billion in both 2019 and 2020 after accounting for capital expenditure and dividends, according to Jefferies analysts’ estimates. An equity hike will pay for the rest but will be neutralised by a buyback, itself funded by asset disposals. BP investors are aware that BHP spent $30 billion trying to make the most of the assets before today’s deal, and had to swallow a final $2.8 billion writedown on Friday. But the logic behind the oil major’s own deal is sound. Reuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

128,2017-12-13 00:00:00,2017,12.0,13,,Australian watchdog blocks BP buy of Woolworths petrol stations,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia’s antitrust regulator on Thursday blocked BP Plc’s (BP.L) A$1.8 billion ($1.4 billion) purchase of Woolworths Ltd’s (WOW.AX) petrol stations, even after the oil company offered to sell some stations to ease competition concerns. BP and Woolworths, which wants to exit the business to focus on its supermarkets, said they were disappointed by the decision after months of talks with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and were reviewing what to do next. Decisions by the commission can be challenged in court. “We remain confident that, with appropriate divestments as offered by BP, this transaction would not substantially lessen competition,” BP Australia President Andy Holmes said in a statement. “In light of this, we are currently consulting with our lawyers to determine our next steps.” Woolworths shares initially fell 1.4 percent after the announcement but recovered to trade down 0.7 percent in a broader market that was up slightly. While the asset sale was blocked, its petrol retail revenue stream remains unaffected. Investors said the rejection was not a total surprise, given the regulator had flagged concerns about the deal earlier this year. The acquisition was announced in December 2016. “I don’t think it’s significant for Woolworths,” said Stephen Bruce, a portfolio manager at Perennial Value Management, an investor in Woolworths. The main issue for Woolworths is that following any sale of its petrol stations it wants its supermarket shoppers to continue to receive fuel discounts from the new owner, which the regulator cleared separately on Thursday. The blocked acquisition boosted BP rival Caltex Australia Ltd (CTX.AX), which stood to lose a major fuel supply contract with Woolworths that it said previously would have cost it up to A$150 million in lost earnings before interest and tax, or 15 percent of its forecast earnings for 2017. Caltex shares rose as much as 5.2 percent. The company said on Thursday it would continue to supply Woolworths. The competition watchdog said BP’s acquisition would likely lead to higher fuel prices, highlighting that BP’s prices on average were sharply higher than Woolworths in Australia’s big cities. It said BP tended to raise fuel prices faster than Woolworths and lower them more slowly in response to oil price changes. If Woolworths were no longer a competitor on pricing, it added, all remaining players would raise their fuel prices. “The bottom line is that we consider motorists will end up paying more, regardless of where they buy fuel, if this acquisition goes ahead,” ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement.

The world’s biggest oil traders have counted hefty losses after a surprise doubling in the price discount of U.S. light crude to benchmark Brent in just a month, as surging U.S. production upended the market. “It was a tough market to call. We’re certainly not the only trading group that lost money in the second quarter,” he said, adding that oil trading, which gets reported through BP’s downstream business, had made losses twice before in the last five years. “There were some specific positions around some particularly difficult market calls and we got the call wrong, it’s as simple as that.” Over the first half, oil trading made a profit, Gilvary said. “It was about one specific position in one book where they made the wrong market call and actually they did a very good job of exiting that position,” he said, declining to give further details. Trading desks of oil major BP and merchants Vitol, Gunvor and Trafigura have recorded losses in the tens of millions of dollars each as a result of the “whipsaw” move when the spread reached more than $11.50 a barrel in June, insiders familiar with their performance told Reuters. Shell Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl said last week that Shell’s oil trading profits fell short of expectations in the first half of the year. Gilvary said he expected oil prices to stay within a $5 range around current prices for the next six months.

136,2018-11-22 00:00:00,2018,11.0,22,Wendell Roelf,"BP to invest $1 billion in South Africa, including refinery upgrade","CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - BP Southern Africa (BPSA) will invest $1 billion in South Africa in the next five years with more than a quarter of that set aside to upgrade the SAPREF refinery to produce lower sulfur diesel, its chief executive said on Thursday. The 180,00 barrels per day SAPREF refinery, South Africa’s largest, is a 50:50 venture between Royal Dutch Shell and BPSA, a subsidiary of British oil major BP. The plant is located in the east coast city of Durban. BP would invest 3.5 billion-4 billion rand ($252 million-$288 million) in the refinery upgrade, Chief Executive Priscillah Mabelane told Reuters, adding that about 40 percent of the total $1 billion investment would go on retail activities. She said the upgrade would make “sure the refinery can meet the new specifications in terms of low sulfur and Marpol regulations.” The plant would shut for maintenance from May to June 2019, she added. The upgrade has been driven by new rules demanding a lower fuel sulfur content and changing customer preferences for cleaner diesel, such as D50 and D10. Refinery operators have been in long-running talks with government on how to recover costs from upgrading work needed to produce cleaner fuel in South Africa, the continent’s most industrialised economy. “From an industry perspective we are pushing very hard to ensure that there is policy clarity because we have been on this journey very long, almost a decade,” Mabelane said about the ongoing talks. Industry players estimated in 2009 that the cost to upgrade to cleaner fuels would be about $4 billion. Other operators in the sector include Total and Sasol. Besides upgrading the refinery, Mabelane said BPSA would expand its retail activities in South Africa. “We are aggressively going to grow our footprint in the country,” she said on the sidelines of an event with retailer partner Pick n Pay to launch a new innovation for a loyalty card that will also work at BP fuel stations nationwide. BP was looking at opportunities to expand its services in Mozambique, where it is the second largest oil company, Mabelane said. “The market is exciting and dynamic,” she said.

141,2017-04-06 00:00:00,2017,4.0,6,,U.S. granted BP license to operate joint North Sea field with Iran,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP and Iran’s state-run oil company received a license from the U.S. Treasury last year to operate their joint gas field in the North Sea following the lifting of Western sanctions on Tehran, BP said on Thursday. Production at the Rhum field was suspended in 2010 when Europe imposed sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program and only resumed four years later after Britain agreed to set up a temporary management scheme whereby all revenue due to Tehran would be held until sanctions were lifted. Following the removal of European Union and United Nations sanctions on Iran in January 2016, the temporary management scheme ceased. Iran regained control of its stake and on Sept. 29, 2016 BP obtained a license from the U.S. Treasury, through its sanctions enforcement arm - the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC), to continue operations at the field, BP said in its 2016 annual report. BP, which was founded more than a century ago as the Anglo-Persian oil company, has multiple business operations in the United States and therefore needs an OFAC license to avoid potential breaches of existing U.S. sanctions. Last year BP created an executive committee to explore business in Iran, which would exclude its American chief executive Bob Dudley in a bid to avoid potential sanctions violations. London-based BP recorded a net profit of $31.6 million in 2016 from its 50 percent stake in the field, which supplies around 4 percent of Britain’s gas demand. “BP currently intends to continue to hold its ownership stake in the Rhum joint arrangement and act as operator,” it said in the annual report. While international sanctions on Iran were removed more than a year ago, the United States has held separate measures in place and President Donald Trump’s administration has promised a tough line. BP did not specify for how long the Rhum field license was valid. Previous U.S. President Barack Obama tried to encourage non-U.S. companies and non-U.S. banks to increase trade with Iran, although Tehran said Washington did not do enough to ease its access to international financial markets and banks for vital capital after years of isolation.

The meeting, attended by BP CEO Robert Dudley, Glencore CEO Ivan Glasenberg and Vitol’s Chairman Ian Taylor, among others, is a rare gathering in the Kremlin of some of the world’s most influential energy players. Russia, one of the world’s top oil producers and exporters, has been under Western sanctions since 2014, which include restrictions on some financial instruments and development of some types of energy resources by foreign firms. Putin, in opening remarks before the meeting was closed to reporters, said that Russia “is doing all (that’s) necessary so that foreign investors, our partners, friends feel themselves as comfortable as possible on the Russian market”. He did not elaborate. Dudley, once the head of TNK-BP, a Russia-British joint venture bought by Rosneft in 2013 for $55 billion, last met Putin in February. BP now holds a 19.75 stake in Rosneft, whose CEO Igor Sechin was also present on Wednesday. Glasenberg and Taylor are rare visitors to the Kremlin, though they usually attend the economic forum in St Petersburg. Glencore has a wide range of interests in Russia from oil trading to aluminum and power assets, while Vitol is active in oil trading as well. Putin has invited all the company bosses to take part in an economic forum in St Petersburg, a ‘Russian Davos’, in June. The Kremlin meeting comes amid talk that U.S.companies could boycott Moscow’s showcase forum in June following Russia’s arrest of prominent U.S. investor Michael Calvey on embezzlement charges. Calvey denies the charges. The Kremlin called Wednesday’s gathering a ‘meeting with representatives of the UK business circles’. Russia-UK relations also turned frosty after Britain accused Moscow of the poisoning of a former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal - accusations Moscow denies. “As a group here we are grateful for the opportunity to participate in the effort in restoring trust and mutually beneficial relationships between our two countries,” Dudley said in his opening remarks.

We have seen a rapid de-leveraging, and foresee a solid cash generation combined with a strong liquidity position,” the company, 30 percent owned by BP, said in a statement. Aker BP expects its production to be between 155,000 and 160,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day (boepd) in 2018 compared with a proforma output of 160,000 boepd in 2017, it added. The company said production could rise up to 330,000 boepd in 2023, including both approved and yet to be approved projects, up from a previous estimate of 270,000 boepd. “We are well positioned for further growth. The acquisition of Hess Norge in 2017 significantly enhanced our production and resource base ...,” Aker BP Chief Executive Karl Johnny Hersvik said. The company plans investments of about $1.3 billion in 2018, with exploration expected to account for $350 million and decommissioning expenditure $350 million. Following the acquisition of Hess Norge and approval of three new developments at the end of 2017, the company revised its reserves up by 202 million boe to 913 million boe. Aker BP plans to drill 12 exploration wells in 2018, up from nine wells last year, with potential discovery estimates ranging from 50 to 150 million boe net for the company.

146,2018-11-28 00:00:00,2018,11.0,28,Marcelo Teixeira,BP sees Brazil's new biofuels policy boosting investment,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil’s latest policy to boost biofuels use has improved the outlook for ethanol production and should attract new investment in plants, BP Plc’s chief executive for biofuels, Mario Lindenhayn, said on Wednesday. Brazil is advancing with additional regulation for the policy, called RenovaBio and expected to be enacted in 2020, Lindenhayn said, adding that he does not see signs that the government of President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, which kicks off in January, would put up obstacles. “We are very positive. This is a very important signal the country is giving, creating a stable regulatory environment that will allow companies to invest,” Lindenhayn told Reuters on the sidelines of an energy presentation at the company’s corporate office in Sao Paulo. RenovaBio will mandate fuel distributors to gradually increase the amount of biofuels they sell. The program aims to double the use of ethanol by 2030 from around 26 billion liters currently. The program also targets increases for other renewables such as biodiesel. BP has three ethanol mills in Brazil, crushing 10 million tonnes of sugar cane per year. It formed a venture last year with Brazil’s Copersucar, a leading global ethanol seller, to jointly operate one of the largest fuel terminals in the country located in Paulínia, in Sao Paulo state. Lindenhayn said the program provides an opportunity for mills in Brazil, which have experienced stagnation caused by years of low sugar prices and a long period of subsidized gasoline prices that led to the closure of many firms. “If the program advances as planned, it will be a large opportunity. There are no greenfield projects around, and the country is a net fuel importer,” he said. Asked if BP would be interested in increasing ethanol capacity via acquisitions, since there are several assets being offered in Brazil by companies with financial difficulties, Lindenhayn said: “We will see, we will consider.” On Wednesday, Brazilian oil and fuels regulator ANP published in the official gazette another part of RenovaBio complementary legislation, with rules for biofuel companies to obtain certification. With that, the plants will be able to issue and trade emissions reductions credits, called CBios, that fuel distributors could buy to comply with targets in case they fall short. It would be Brazil’s first emissions reductions market, although limited to the fuels industry.

Other members of the consortium include Norwegian oil firm Statoil, trading houses Gunvor, Koch Supply & Trading, and Mercuria, and banks ABN Amro, ING and Societe Generale. Blockchain technology, which first emerged as the architecture underpinning cryptocurrency bitcoin, uses a shared database that updates itself in real-time and can process and settle transactions in minutes using computer algorithms, with no need for third-party verification. Mercuria has been a vocal advocate of implementing blockchain technology to significantly cut costs in oil trading. “Ideally, it would help to eliminate any confusion over ownership of a cargo and potentially help to make managing risk more exact if there are accurate timestamps to each part of the trade,” said Edward Bell, commodities analyst at Dubai-based lender Emirates NBD PJSC. Similar efforts for an energy trading platform have failed to take off, Bell said, but added this latest bid with backing from BP and Shell and the banks, “may have more success than if it were an independent party trying to convince oil and gas companies to make use of it.” The new venture is seeking regulatory approvals and would be run as an independent entity, the consortium said in a statement. “The platform aims to reduce administrative operational risks and costs of physical energy trading, and improve the reliability and efficiency of back-end trading operations...,” the statement said.

149,2018-06-05,2018,6.0,5,Vlad Savov,Asus’ VivoWatch BP monitors your blood pressure and fitness metrics,"Asus has been perusing the World Health Organization’s statistics, noticing that one in five people now suffer from high blood pressure, complications from which account for 9.4 million deaths worldwide. So the tech company is doing something to address that by introducing its new VivoWatch BP, a modern take on the typically cumbersome and immobile blood pressure monitors from the likes of Omron. Of course, Asus is hardly alone in trying, as Omron itself has shown off wrist-worn blood pressure monitors, but this latest VivoWatch is probably the most compact, lightweight, and streamlined design of its kind. Asus uses a combination of EKG (electrocardiogram) and PPG (photoplethysmography) sensors to achieve an accurate reading of the VivoWatch BP wearer’s blood pressure and heart rate. I tried the watch out for myself here at Computex, and the first and most impressive thing about it is how light it is. Sure, it’s sinfully chunky with those massive bezels around an unimpressive display, but it’s not uncomfortable to wear and, should you need frequent and convenient blood pressure readings, it seems a good solution to the problem. To get a measurement, you have to press a finger on the PPG sensor at the top and hold it there for 15 to 20 seconds. I struggled to get the first VivoWatch I tried to detect me, but another one was quite consistent and seemed accurate. It identified my blood pressure as what it usually is, and it didn’t deviate wildly when I repeated the test a few times. Aside from blood pressure measurement, the VivoWatch BP also does all the standard health tracker things like keeping an eye on your heart rate, sleep patterns, and activity. Where Asus seems to be over-promising is in its claims that the VivoWatch is also capable of monitoring the quality of your sleep and a buzzwordy thing that the company calls de-stress index. Using an associated HealthAI app, Asus will try to offer personalized health advice to users based on the data it collects about them. The company even plans to let users share the health information collected by the VivoWatch BP with family members and doctors, though I wasn’t able to obtain a satisfactory answer about the privacy and security of this. Having grown up around grandparents with high blood pressure pumping up inflatable cuffs on their arms (called a sphygmomanometer, apparently!) every time they needed to get a measurement, I find this VivoWatch BP a commendable advance in health tech. By smartwatch or sport watch standards, it’s nothing special, and it’s certainly a big and wide thing to wear on your wrist. But this watch shrinks down the equipment and effort required for a reasonably accurate blood pressure measurement dramatically. Asus claims the VivoWatch BP represents a 70 percent reduction in size and 50 percent reduction in weight relative to comparable alternatives. With a battery life of 28 days and an ultra-spartan OS and operation, it’s certainly designed to maximize simplicity and accessibility.

Production at the field follows on from BP’s onshore compression and Juniper projects in Trinidad, West Nile Delta Phase 1 in Egypt, Persephone in Australia and the Quad 204 project West of Shetland. There remains only the Eni-operated Zohr project in Egypt which is on schedule to start before year end. These seven projects are expected to make a significant contribution to the 800,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production that BP expects to add by 2020, more than offsetting a decline in the base portfolio and so contributing to rising production and – with higher margins that the average of the portfolio – cash flows. (on.bp.com/2xpGPIL) About 300 wells are expected to be drilled over the lifetime of the Khazzan field, BP said, adding that the two planned phases will develop an estimated 10.5 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas resources. BP, which has had an upstream presence in Oman since 2007, is lead partner in the project with a 60 percent interest. Oman Oil Company Exploration & Production holds 40 percent.

154,2019-04-11 00:00:00,2019,4.0,11,"Meng Meng, Chen Aizhu",BP latest oil major to exit China's shale gas after poor drilling results,"SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - European oil major BP plans to exit from two production sharing contracts (PSC) for projects drilling for shale gas in the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan, three sources with the knowledge of the matter said this week. BP is the last of the international oil majors, including Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and ENI, to quit exploring for shale gas in China because of poor drilling results. Its departure leaves the sector firmly in the hands of domestic companies. In March 2016, BP agreed with China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) to explore and produce natural gas from shale rock formations in the Neijiang-Dazu block in Sichuan, its first such contract in China. It inked a second PSC on the Rongchangbei block later in 2016. CNPC was the operator in both deals. BP no longer wants to proceed with the Sichuan projects after drilling eight to 10 wells with disappointing results, two of the three sources said. One of the wells, the Wei 206-H1 that was drilled to a depth of 4,368 meters (14,300 feet) in the Neijiang-Dazu block, produced about 10,000 cubic meters a day of gas during test production, a fraction of the output from a typical CNPC shale gas well in the same geological zone, IHS Markit said in a research note. China is only just beginning to develop its vast shale gas resources with production last year making up only 6 percent of total natural gas output, because of geology that makes gas extraction difficult and a challenging operating environment. With BP and the other oil majors gone, PetroChina Co, CNPC’s listed arm, and Sinopec Corp are likely to dominate China’s shale gas sector using low-cost technology and services developed domestically. BP’s Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said last week at a conference in Shanghai that the Sichuan projects faced “great challenges” because of its complex geology. To overcome those problems, BP used technology from its shale developments in the United States at the Sichuan site, Chinese business news portal The Paper reported. BP did not immediately respond to request for comment. PetroChina declined to comment.

155,2016-05-23 00:00:00,2016,5.0,23,"Ron Bousso, Dmitry Zhdannikov",BP's oil search strategy shrinks with budget cuts,"LONDON (Reuters) - The surprise departure of BP’s exploration boss has turned the spotlight on an oil search strategy that, after years of spending cuts, is focusing mainly on expanding existing fields rather than venturing expensively into the unknown. That caution reflects a firm chastened by the $55 billion cost of its 2010 Gulf of Mexico spill, and needing to squeeze every last drop out of a sharply reduced exploration budget at a time of low oil prices. “Exploration doesn’t necessarily have to look like (nature broadcaster) David Attenborough standing on a brand new frontier,” a BP source told Reuters. While BP’s total reserves and fields coming onstream in the next four years look healthy compared to the other majors, its long-term project pipeline is the slimmest among its peers and its break-even costs are the highest, according to some analysts, among them Macquarie. Several BP sources said Chief Executive Bob Dudley and his team were hammering out a new long-term strategy, with investors expecting an update on its post-2020 plans later this year or early next. The plan is likely to chime with a phrase that Dudley is fond of using: “Big is not necessarily beautiful.” After asset sales forced on it by the Gulf disaster shrank the company by a third, BP is today focusing its operations on five regions — Angola, Azerbaijan, Egypt, the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea. It was in Angola, Egypt and the North Sea, already BP core regions, that Richard Herbert notched up his main successes during his two years as head of exploration. BP said his departure followed its decision to bring exploration and field development under one upstream team, headed since February by Bernard Looney. But Herbert, who worked with Dudley in Russia in the 2000s, had also seen his annual budget shrink from $3.5 billion in 2013 to $1 billion this year - not enough to drill even a dozen complex deep-water wells, and certainly not enough to throw at a frontier exploration with potential high gain, but also a high risk of coming out empty-handed. Royal Dutch/Shell (RDSa.L) sank $7 billion into an Alaskan exploration that it abandoned last year - something BP simply cannot afford. While BP’s existing resources are not small compared to its peers, analysts say the lack of a long-term project pipeline is a worry. BP’s reserves-to-production ratio, the number of years reserves can sustain current production, is the third highest among oil majors at nearly 13 years, excluding output from Russia’s Rosneft, in which BP has a near-20 percent stake. It trails only Exxon Mobil’s (XOM.N) 17 years and Total’s (TOTF.PA) 13.5, but is more than Shell, Eni(ENI.MI) or Chevron (CVX.N). By 2020, the startup of projects such as the West Nile Delta in Egypt and the Clair Ridge field in the North Sea will have added 800,000 bpd of oil equivalent to its oil and gas output capacity, Dudley told Reuters last year. In the short term, that appears to be comfortably enough to offset shrinking output from mature fields and maintain or increase a current output level of around 2 million bpd. But another indicator, the reserves replacement ratio (RRR) - new proven but unexploited discoveries as a proportion of annual production - reveals a less rosy picture. BP’s RRR fell last year to 61 percent, its lowest in many years, from 129 percent in 2013. The RRR reflects not only a failure to unlock new deposits - a problem for all the multinationals - but also a reluctance to commit investment as oil prices languish about 60 percent below mid-2014 levels. Among BP’s rivals, Shell’s RRR was negative last year, while that of Eni, fresh from discovering the giant Zohr field off Egypt, was 148 percent. Some of the seemingly promising projects that Herbert inherited from his predecessor, Mike Daly, have proved disappointing. In Brazil, a corruption investigation has slowed projects for other majors as well as BP. Turmoil in Libya has forced it to write off some investments there, while low oil prices have hurt development of the Canadian oil sands. Australian authorities have also refused so far to allow BP to explore the Great Australian Bight, an untapped basin off the southern coast, amid environment protests. BP has said it plans to make further acquisitions to build its resource base, such as the doubling of its stake in the North Sea Culzean field announced this week. But Macquarie analyst Iain Reid said BP’s pipeline of new projects, totaling 1.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent, was the lowest among the world’s top five oil companies. “BP has the lowest amount of pre-FID (final investment decision) resource, which leads to the weakest future growth rates,” Reid said. BP’s project break-even costs are also the highest in the group at around $72 a barrel, according to Macquarie. “BP’s portfolio looks thin compared to peers, hence we continue to believe that it will need to acquire further resource to supplement the current project list and provide stronger growth at lower costs than its current portfolio.” Editing by Kevin Liffey",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bp-exploration-idUSKCN0YE0HB,Business News,Reuters

The Jesuit-educated barrister, who also served as Ireland’s youngest attorney general and then youngest European Union commissioner during the 1980s, had been ill for some time, Irish broadcaster RTE reported, citing a statement from his family.  “Peter Sutherland was a statesman in every sense of the word; an Irishman, a committed European and a proud internationalist,” Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said in a statement. “He had a passion for public affairs and made a significant contribution to Ireland, Europe and the world over a number of decades.” Born in Dublin in 1946, Sutherland was appointed, at the age of 35, as the state’s most senior lawyer after little more than a decade at the bar. Four years later he was nominated as Ireland’s EU commissioner, holding the competition portfolio as the EU’s single market began to take shape. Sutherland returned from Brussels briefly in 1989 and after a stint as chairman of Allied Irish Banks he became the WTO’s first chief in 1995, having previously been head of its precursor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Praising his international contribution to business, politics and human rights, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Sunday described Sutherland as “a giant of Irish, European and international public life”. A spokesman for the WTO said that Sutherland’s leadership, vision and courage were instrumental in the birth of the world trade body and that the lengthy Uruguay Round negotiations that led to its creation were by no means assured until the Irishman took charge. While spearheading the WTO, Sutherland took up his roles at Goldman Sachs and BP. He was the oil major’s longest-serving chairman, from 1997 to 2009, and held that role even longer at Goldman Sachs International, retiring in 2015 after 20 years in the job. A passionate advocate of globalization and the EU and one of Ireland’s best known public figures on the international stage, Sutherland continued in his role as United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General for International Migration until close to his death. “He leaves an important legacy through his work as Secretary-General, having brought the importance of migration to the forefront of public thought and policy,” Irish President Michael D. Higgins said in a statement.

Tesla will supply the 212 kilowatt (KW)/840 kilowatt hour battery at BP’s Titan 1 windfarm in South Dakota in the second half of this year. It operates 12 other windfarms in the United States. Providing large-scale battery power to windfarms allows them to store energy when wind is ample and make electricity available when demand is high, offering a crucial commercial advantage to an otherwise volatile energy source. “Lessons from the project will enable BP to make better informed decisions when evaluating and developing battery applications in the future,” BP said in a statement. “The project also supports BP’s broader strategy to invest half a billion dollars annually into low-carbon technologies, including projects within its established renewables portfolio as well as in new low-carbon businesses.” Several oil firms have already invested in battery technology. Norway’s Statoil plans to use a battery system, called Batwind, with its Hywind floating wind farm off the coast of Scotland. Vitol-owned VPI Immingham has developed a 50 megawatt, grid-connected battery portfolio in Britain. BP estimates renewables could account for around 10 percent of global energy demand by 2035, up from 4 percent currently.

160,2019-06-03 00:00:00,2019,6.0,3,,Senegal's opposition calls for inquiry on BP gas deal,"DAKAR, June 3 (Reuters) - A group of opposition politicians in Senegal called on Monday for an investigation of the history of two major offshore gas blocks run by BP after a report alleging fraud involving President Macky Sall’s brother Aliou Sall. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) on Monday published an investigation alleging that in a previously unpublished arrangement, BP agreed to pay Timis Corporation, a company run by Romanian-Australian tycoon Frank Timis, around $10 billion in royalty payments for its stake in the blocks. The report said the early history of the acreage, which contains one of the largest deposits of gas in the world, was mired by fraud involving Timis, who has mining and energy interests across Africa. The BBC alleged that Timis in 2014 secretly paid $250,000 to a company run by Aliou Sall called Agritrans, based on a trove of documents it reviewed. It said Timis also paid Aliou Sall $1.5 million in salary over five years for his work in Petro-Tim, the company originally given the blocks before Timis Corporation, and that he was also offered $3 million in shares in Timis companies. Aliou Sall denied receiving the $250,000 payment from Timis and called the BBC’s report “totally false”. BP said in a statement that it “rejects any implication that it acted improperly in the acquisition of our interests in Senegal” and that it “conducted extensive and appropriate due diligence” before acquiring the license. It said the $10 billion figure quoted by the BBC was “wholly inaccurate”. Timis was not reachable for comment, but he told the BBC in a statement that there had been “no wrongdoing whatsoever”. Senegal’s offshore oil and gas reserves have the potential to transform the impoverished West African country when they start flowing in the next decade, likely in volumes rivalling some of the region’s biggest producers. The blocks, called Cayar Offshore Profond and St. Louis Profond, have caused controversy since 2012, when a previously unknown company called Petro-Tim was unexpectedly awarded the license despite having no known track record in the industry. Soon after, the president’s brother was hired at the company. Protests against the deal erupted in the capital Dakar in 2016, casting a shadow over Sall’s first term. “The public prosecutor must immediately initiate actions to unravel fraudulent and corrupt contracts,” said an influential group of opposition organisations called the Conference of Leaders, which includes former and current senior politicians. They said the National Assembly should “initiate measures that will require those responsible for the crimes to appear before the High Court of Justice.” Reporting by Edward McAllister and Juliette Jabkhiro; Editing

161,2017-04-17 00:00:00,2017,4.0,17,Jarrett Renshaw,BP accuses Monroe Energy of wrongfully terminating contract,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BP Plc has accused Monroe Energy of wrongfully terminating a crude supply contract in 2016, costing the oil major at least $59 million in damages, according to a federal court filing. BP said in the filing that Monroe Energy, a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines Inc , terminated the contract after misinterpreting a provision regarding the blending of crude oils. BP declined to comment further on the case and Monroe could not be immediately reached. Monroe has yet to respond to the allegations in court. The dispute with Monroe marks at least the second time in the past two years that BP has been accused by a refiner of supplying lesser-grade crudes. NARL Refining is embroiled in an arbitration dispute with BP that involves allegations that the oil major was providing crude oil at the company’s Come-By-Chance refinery in Newfoundland, Canada, that helped BP’s profits but hurt the refinery’s equipment. Monroe Energy inked a three-year contract with BP in August 2014 to supply the company’s 185,000 barrel-per-day refinery outside Philadelphia with crude oil from the Eagle Ford or Bakken shale fields, according to the lawsuit filed on Thursday in U.S. District Court in Southern New York. Monroe agreed to pay $8.35 above the U.S. benchmark price for Eagle Ford and $7.35 above the U.S. benchmark for Bakken deliveries, according to the lawsuit. The supply contract was favorable for Monroe when U.S. crude sold at a wide discount against the global benchmark during the early months of the deal, but the spread narrowed significantly in late 2015, making global crude more attractive to East Coast refiners. Monroe notified BP last June that it was severing the contract, alleging the oil major was intentionally blending batches of Eagle Ford crude that did not meet the API gravity grade called for in the contract, according to the lawsuit. BP said the agreement had no language that barred it from commingling grades of crude oil from the same fields, court papers showed. BP says it blended batches of Eagle Ford crude from different wells, calling it a routine industry practice. BP also said Monroe used gravity figures measured at the docks in Texas, not at the point of delivery as required by contract, according to the lawsuit. Monroe never complained the delivered crude was not in compliance, BP said. “Monroe’s allegations were nothing more than an unfounded pretext to terminate the (contract),” BP said in the filing.

Monroe Energy, a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines that owns a 185,000 barrel-per-day refinery outside of Philadelphia, said the blending of lower quality crudes is prohibited under the supply contract. The company asked a U.S. District Court judge in New York on June 7 to dismiss BP’s April lawsuit alleging Monroe wrongfully severed the deal. The motion for dismissal has not been previously reported. BP was allowed to blend Eagle Ford crudes from different wells under its contract but only if each blend met specific API gravity and vapor pressure requirements. Blending lower-grade crude is an industry tactic used to boost returns on less desirable oil, said Monroe, which filed a motion to have the suit dismissed. BP said in its initial complaint that it blended batches of crude out of Texas’s Eagle Ford shale play prior to delivery. The company said the two parties specifically discussed such blending before a three-year deal was signed in 2014. Monroe unilaterally ended the deal in June 2016. “Monroe Energy has breached the contract for delivered crude product in an apparent attempt to avoid paying the agreed-upon price for the crude BP supplies,” BP said in a written statement on Monday, adding that Monroe had accepted the product without complaint.  Monroe declined comment on Monday.

The joint venture is the largest deal in Brazil’s bioenergy sector since Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) joined forces with Cosan (CSAN3.SA) to form industry leader Raízen in 2011. Together, Bunge and BP will manage 11 cane processing plants in Brazil with capacity to crush 32 million tonnes of cane per year, putting them behind just Raízen and Biosev, which is controlled by commodities trader Louis Dreyfus. The deal gives BP a role in Brazil’s booming ethanol market ahead of a new federal policy next year aimed at boosting use of biofuels, which are used interchangeably with gasoline in Brazilian passenger cars. “Brazil is the Saudi Arabia of biofuel,” BP’s head of Alternative Energy, Dev Sanyal, told Reuters. He added that the new venture was cash-flow positive. Bunge said it will receive cash proceeds of $775 million as part of the agreement, which it expects to use to cut debt. But the company said in a U.S. filing that it is planning a third-quarter impairment charge “in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion” related to the “cumulative currency translation effects” of its business in Brazil. Bunge shares opened up more than 3% higher in New York before reducing gains to 1.4%. BP rose 0.3% in London. The U.S.-based company has tried to sell its sugar operation in Brazil in the past with no success. It then tried listing shares of the unit in Sao Paulo last year, but canceled the plan, citing adverse market conditions. Bunge sold its sugar trading business to Wilmar International Ltd last year. Its bioenergy unit posted losses in five of the past six quarters and the company forecast results for the unit would be roughly break-even in 2019. “This partnership with BP represents a major portfolio optimization milestone for Bunge which allows us to reduce our current exposure to sugar milling,” Bunge CEO Gregory Heckman said in a statement. Market conditions have improved for ethanol in Brazil, with strong demand and better prices, but the global sugar market remains challenging. SBc1 “I think the companies together will be able to have large synergies, there will be great optimization of resources and cost reductions,” said Arnaldo Corrêa, a sugar and ethanol consultant in Brazil. “It is great news for the sector, because the deal creates a much stronger player. All those worries about the future of Bunge’s assets disappeared,” he added. The joint venture, named BP Bunge Bioenergia, will operate on a standalone basis, headquartered in Sao Paulo. Besides sugar and ethanol, the company has capacity to produce electricity fueled by waste biomass from sugarcane. “The new company will certainly focus on fuel and electricity, which will have a growing importance as Brazil’s economy recovers,” said Plinio Nastari, chief analyst at Brazilian consultancy Datagro. “Brazil has a deficit of fuel production,” said Mario Lindenhayn, head of biofuels at BP and future chairman of the new JV, adding that the company has its eye on new Asian ethanol markets. The deal, expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2019, includes exit rights after 18 months including a private sale. Bunge has an option to launch a share offering after two years. “We have a strong, committed partner in BP, as well as flexibility in the medium- and long-term for further monetization, with full exit potential via an IPO or other strategic route,” said Bunge’s Heckman.

BP invested $90 billion in the United States over the past decade, excluding $65 billion in fines and clean up costs over the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, making it the country’s biggest investor in the energy sector, Dudley said. “The regulatory system in the United States is suddenly so much easier. It was becoming an avalanche of regulations in every direction,” he said. “From a business community stand point this is quite transformational, there will be a lot of capital attracted to the U.S. because of that.” BP took a one-off charge of $900 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to adjust to new U.S. tax rules, though it expects a long-term boost from the corporate-friendly rates.

The rating agency bumped BP up one notch to A1 and said the London-based company’s outlook was positive. Moody’s last upgraded BP’s long-term issuer rating in 1998, a spokesman said. “Our decision to upgrade BP to A1 factors in the increased clarity around the size and timing of remaining cash payments linked to the Deep Water Horizon incident, as well as expected improvements to BP’s credit metrics and its strong operating performance despite high oil price volatility,” said Elena Nadtotchi, vice president and senior credit officer at Moody’s. The settlement of the Deepwater Horizon fines and clean up costs in 2015 brought BP’s pretax bill to more than $62 billion. The company will pay the charge gradually into the 2030s. BP, like other oil companies, slashed spending and costs in the wake of a sharp drop in oil prices from mid-2014. It is aiming to be able to general cashflow at oil prices of $35-$40 a barrel by the end of the decade. “BP demonstrated strong operating performance amid high volatility in oil prices,” according to Moody’s. It is set to see a sharp rise in production in the coming years as it starts up eight projects this year, including in Oman and Azerbaijan, the largest number in the company’s history in a single year. The company hopes to add 800,000 barrels per day of new production by the end of the decade. “The positive outlook recognises that BP’s strong business profile may sustain a higher rating and anticipates that the company will continue to deliver strong operating performance in 2017-19, supported by growth and improving profitability of the upstream, and rising contribution from the downstream,” Moody’s said. Of 29 analysts surveyed by Reuters, 14 have ‘buy’ or ‘strong buy’ recommendations on BP, and 14 a ‘hold’ recommendation. BP’s debt at the end of March was $28.6 billion, which represents 28 percent of the company’s equity capital, also known as gearing.

The existing deal is due to expire in 2024 and BP-led consortium and Azeri state oil firm SOCAR signed a letter of intent in December to continue developing the giant Azeri-Chirag-Guneshly (ACG) offshore fields until 2050. “End of June is a very reasonable time for it,” Gary Jones, BP’s regional head for Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, told reporters when asked when the contract was due to be signed. “It’s a big deal.

179,2018-08-27 00:00:00,2018,8.0,27,,Total rules out investing in U.S. shale oil after BP-BHP deal,"STAVANGER, Norway (Reuters) - French energy group Total (TOTF.PA) is not looking at investing in the U.S. shale oil industry, the company’s chief executive said on Monday. Patrick Pouyanne made the comment when asked whether peer BP’s (BP.L) $10.5 billion acquisition of U.S. shale assets from BHP Billiton BLT.L(BHP.AX) had made the sector more attractive. “It’s first quite expensive, second we don’t have the human resources. BP had the human resources, BP had already a position, so I can understand their move but it’s not my case,” Pouyanne said on the sidelines of an oil conference. BP’s acquisition of about 500,000 producing acres marked a turning point for the group since the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, for which the company is still paying off more than $65 billion in penalties and clean-up costs. Shell (RDSa.L) and Norway’s Equinor (EQNR.OL) have also invested in U.S. shale, but Eni (ENI.MI) and Total have been cautious. U.S. shale veteran and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD.N) Chairman Scott Sheffield rang an optimistic note when asked at the conference about European oil and gas companies investing in U.S. shale. “Eventually I think more and more majors will get there, (because) it’s the fastest-growing region for the next 10 years in the world. And so if you’re not in the Permian ... then you’d better find growth somewhere else,” Sheffield said. He was referring to the Permian basin, which stretches across western Texas and eastern New Mexico.

BP’s rival Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) said last week it would incur a one-off charge of $2-$2.5 billion for the U.S. tax changes. Like BP, Shell and many other international companies said they expected a long-term positive impact to U.S. earnings from the massive $1.5 trillion tax overhaul that U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law last month. It cuts the corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and temporarily reduces the tax burden for most individuals as well. But BP said that in the short term, lower tax rates will affect its deferred tax assets and liabilities, resulting in a one-off, non-cash charge of $1.5 billion to its 2017 fourth quarter results which are due to be announced on Feb. 8. “The ultimate impact of the change in the U.S. corporate income tax rate is subject to a number of complex provisions in the legislation which BP is reviewing,” BP said in a statement. The British company’s shares closed down about 1 percent on Tuesday. The adjustment will not affect BP’s cash flow in the fourth quarter. Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), the world’s largest publicly traded oil producer, declined to comment on how the U.S. tax changes would financially affect it. Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said it was studying the changes but still plans to invest $8 billion in the United States this year. Deferred tax assets refer in some cases to a company overpaying taxes in advance and then getting them back in the form of tax relief. BP has large operations in oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore shale operations as well as refineries that can process up to 746,000 barrels per day of crude oil, according to its website. On Dec. 22, Trump signed the tax overhaul into law, cutting tax rates for businesses and offering some temporary cuts for some individuals and families.

The sale proceeds will partly fund the $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP’s onshore assets that are mostly around oil-producing fields in Texas and Louisiana. BP had said it would sell $5 billion to $6 billion to finance the deal. The London-listed firm wants to focus on production from its holdings in the Permian and Eagle Ford basins to match rivals Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Chevron (CVX.N) whose production there is set to rise sharply in coming years. BP’s onshore business, which it has rebranded as BPX, sent out information packages last week on the assets it was selling and its representatives held a meeting in New York with the management teams of potential buyers, the sources said.     This follows a series of informal talks the company held with private equity firms since the end of November aimed at gauging interest in the assets, two of the sources said.     Interested parties include U.S. buyout funds Carlyle (CG.O) and Warburg Pincus, one of the sources said.     BP, which sources said was not using a banking advisor on the sale, declined to comment. Carlyle and Warburg Pincus were not immediately available for comment. Investors have been stepping up pressure on publicly traded oil firms to curb spending and boost returns. “That pressure is taking public companies out of the universe of buyers in the market, creating opportunities for private-equity companies,” said Andrew Dittmar, an M&A analyst at researcher Drillinginfo. Private equity firms such as Ascent Resources, Aethon Energy Management and Encino Acquisition Partners have all made large purchases of oil-producing assets this year. BP is offering seven packages, all of them consisting of shale assets it held before the BHP deal, two of the sources said.     Those include fields in the San Juan basin which straddles the Colorado-New Mexico border, the Cotton Valley field in East Texas, the Arkoma and Anadarko basins in Oklahoma, and the Wamsutter basin in Wyoming. There are a small number of non-operated stakes being offloaded, the sources said.     The most attractive pieces are thought to be the San Juan assets, which include around 9,000 operated and non-operated wells and were the backbone of BP’s U.S. onshore operations prior to the BHP deal, along with the Wamsutter basin. (For a graphic on 'BP U.S. onshore assets sales' click tmsnrt.rs/2S57CAZ) The sales document says the entire portfolio generates around $700 million in operating cashflow a year.     Most of the assets are gas-rich, which could deter some investors at a time when the abundance of gas production across the United States has pushed down prices for the fuel. The Permian, encompassing parts of Texas and New Mexico, is at the heart of the U.S. shale boom and has some of the lowest production costs in North America, which is valuable when U.S. WTI crude prices CLc1 have slumped almost 40 percent since reaching a peak in October. <O/R>     U.S. shale production is forecast to hit 8.2 million bpd in January, according to the U.S. Energy Department, as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, drives U.S. output to a record 11.7 million barrels per day (bpd), making it the world’s biggest crude producer.

The Interior Department’s Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement announced the finalized regulations, which include more stringent design requirements and operational procedures for offshore U.S. oil and gas operations. The new standards come nearly six years after a deadly explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig off the cost of Louisiana, which led to the worst oil spill of all time. The Macondo well blowout and the fire on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on April 20, 2010, killed 11 workers. “The well control rule is a vital part of our extensive reform agenda to strengthen, update and modernize our offshore energy program using lessons learned from Deepwater Horizon,” said Interior Secretary Sally Jewell. To improve the “culture of safety” on oil rigs and prevent future spills or blowouts, the new rule tightens requirements for blowout preventers, well design, well control casing, cementing and sub-sea containment. It also calls for real-time monitoring, third party reviews of equipment, regular inspections and safe drilling margin requirements. “We listened extensively to industry and other stakeholders and heard their concerns loud and clear,” said Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management Janice Schneider. “This rule includes both prescriptive and performance-based standards.” Ocean protection advocacy group Oceana said that since Congress did not enact legislation to improve offshore drilling safety, the new standards by the Interior Department were “a significant improvement over the status quo.” Oceana Vice President Jacqueline Savitz said many measures in the final rule were standards already used by industry. The Interior Department bureau has reported that offshore drilling caused at least 1,066 injuries, 496 fires and explosions, 22 losses of well control, 11 big oil spills and 11 fatalities since the Deepwater Horizon accident. “The only way to truly ensure there will never be another disaster of the magnitude of Deepwater Horizon is to stop drilling offshore,” Savitz said.

Brent crude prices fell by 34 percent last year after shedding 48 percent in 2014. The plunge in global oil prices has pushed inflation close to or below zero in many countries, helping consumers but wrong-footing central banks. Dudley said a more natural balance between supply and demand could come back in the third and fourth quarter of this year, after which stock levels could start to wear off. “Prices are going to stay lower for longer, we have said it and I think we are in this for a couple of years. For sure, there is a boom-and-bust cycle here,” Dudley said. Dudley also said he did not agree with Bank of England Governor Mark Carney’s use of the term “stranded assets” to describe oil and gas reserves held by companies but which may prove unviable as the world moves to a low-carbon economy. Carney used the phrase in a speech in September in which he called on companies to be more open about their “climate change footprint” to avoid abrupt changes in asset prices that could destabilize markets. “I think the term overstates it quite frankly and I have spoken to the governor about it and I have questioned that term,” Dudley said in the interview. BP shareholders were already aware of the viability of the company’s assets which were only counted as reserves if they were economic, he said.

BP said the total cost of developing the project would be around $1.3 billion. BP has a 56 percent interest in the Atlantis field, while BHP holds the remaining 44 percent. First production for the project is expected in 2020, BHP said in a statement, and is expected to increase production by about 38,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at its peak. BHP said it had also approved $256 million in funding for additional drilling and study at its 60 percent-held Trion field in Mexico. The Mexican government-owned PEMEX holds the rest of Trion.

The 16 megawatt (MW) Wildflower Solar project will be built in California and has secured a 20 year plus power purchase agreement (PPA) with California’s Sacramento Municipal Utility District. Lightsource BP will also develop a 9 MW solar project in New Mexico which has a PPA with New Mexico’s Continental Divide Electric Cooperative. No financial details were released. Both projects will be constructed and completed in 2019, Lightsource BP CEO Nick Boyle said in a phone interview. Oil major BP acquired a 43 percent stake in Lightsource last year. “The U.S. is a hugely important market for BP and it is hugely important for Lightsource BP,” Boyle said. “We are working on a very significant pipeline in the U.S. and this announcement is one of many that will flow though,” he said. Earlier this year Lightsource BP bought a 135 MW portfolio of six solar assets in Pennsylvania and Maryland from Orion Renewable Energy Group LLC.

The PowerShare application, which is used in cities such as Shanghai, will help manage growing pressure on power grids as electric vehicles (EVs) usage surges in the coming decades. With China targeting sales of more than 7 million EVs by 2025, the need to manage demand and distribution of power on the grid, particularly at times of peak demand, will be crucial. BP’s investment is the latest in a string by the London-based oil and gas major and several of its rivals, including Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Total (TOTF.PA), in EV charging as they target future low-carbon economies. Car producers, utility firms and energy companies have doubled down efforts in recent years to find ways to manage the expected surge in power demand. PowerShare helps drivers locate charging points and pay for the supply, while allowing suppliers to optimize to balance demand on the grid, depending on the time of day, for example between city centers and residential areas. “As more and more EVs come on, grid operators are concerned about mobile demand. PowerShare can monitor where vehicles are and where demand is in the system,” Graham Howes, managing director of BP Ventures in Asia, told Reuters. BP, which has invested in fast-charging battery docks and battery storage technologies, did not disclose the size of the investment in PowerShare, but its venturing business typically invests up to ten million dollars in one firm. “We wanted to find a technology that can cope with volume,” Howes said of PowerShare, which is BP Ventures’ first direct investment in China.

The oil company has reduced Dudley’s payout and introduced changes from this year that will lower executives’ performance incentives. The cuts come after around 60 percent of shareholders opposed BP’s pay policy at last year’s annual general meeting. Executive pay has come under growing scrutiny in Britain after a string of corporate scandals, such as the collapse of store chain BHS, which has fueled mistrust of the high levels of pay awarded to company bosses. “We applaud the BP remuneration committee for being proactive in responding to the shareholder revolt last year and see this as a milestone in the engagement between companies and shareholders,” said Ashley Hamilton Claxton, corporate governance manager at Royal London Asset Management. BP’s pay policy changes, which will apply for the coming three years if approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting in London on May 17, include lowering Dudley’s maximum long-term payout to five times salary from seven times and cutting bonus payments by a quarter. “I have consulted widely with shareholders and listened to and sought to act on their concerns, and have been sensitive to developments in the society in which we work,” Ann Dowling, chair of BP’s remuneration committee, said in the company’s annual report published on Thursday. Dudley’s 2016 pay cut was a result of “downward discretion” to the four components of his total pay, the company said. Even after a cut of nearly $8 million, Dudley’s pay remains well above that of rival European oil companies. Shell’s (RDSa.L) Ben van Beurden was awarded an 8.263 million euro ($8.8 million) pay package for 2016, a 60 percent jump year on year, while Total’s (TOTF.PA) Patrick Pouyanne took home 3.8 million euros last year. BP Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary’s overall pay package will be cut by 18 percent to 4.2 million pounds ($5.2 million). Other large British companies, such as Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L) and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), have also cut executives’ pay after shareholders had voiced concerns about their remuneration plans. BP’s annual report also showed the oil company cut a net amount of 2,400 jobs in 2016, after reducing 4,700 roles in 2015, as part of plans to rein in spending in response to weak oil prices.

The company, 30 percent owned by BP, however, maintained its full-year production guidance of 155,000-160,000 boed. It said production in the third quarter was affected by planned maintenance activities at the Skarv and Alvheim fields, as well as reduced exports from Skarv. Production from its Valhall field, which it acquired from Hess a year ago, also rose less than it expected due to a longer than planned well testing program. “As a result, some of the production growth that was expected from Valhall in the third quarter has been moved to coming quarters,” it added. Valhall output stood at 35,100 boed in the third quarter. Aker BP shares were 1.2 percent down by 0827 GMT, underperforming European oil and gas index which was down 0.2 percent. Analysts at Sparebank 1 Markets said the overall third-quarter production was disappointing and may trigger some discussion around downside risk to the company’s overall 2018 guidance.

200,2019-06-05 00:00:00,2019,6.0,5,,Senegal president says truth of BP gas deal will be established,"DAKAR (Reuters) - Senegalese President Macky Sall said on Wednesday the government would find out the truth after a report alleged his brother Aliou Sall had been involved in fraud related to two major offshore gas blocks operated by BP. Making his first comments since the BBC published its report on Monday, the president defended his record in developing the nation’s energy industry but stopped short of calling for a formal investigation, which the opposition have demanded. “I want the truth to be re-established and the government will do this now without delay,” he said after attending prayers for the Eid-al-Fitr Muslim holiday at Dakar’s main mosque. In a statement later on Wednesday, the government rejected the BBC report as one-sided, describing it as “punctuated with serious and false allegations.” “The Senegalese government reserves the right to follow up on this issue as appropriate,” it said. The BBC report alleged that, in a previously unpublished arrangement, BP had agreed to pay Timis Corporation, a firm run by Romanian-Australian tycoon Frank Timis, about $10 billion in royalty payments for its stake in the two blocks. The BBC said that, based on documents it had reviewed, a secret payment of $250,000 was made by Timis to a company run by the president’s brother. The report casts a shadow over Senegal’s energy plans before the first oil and gas starts flowing and despite reassurances from the president that he would root out corruption. Aliou Sall has denied receiving the payment and called the BBC’s report “totally false”. Timis has not been reachable for comment, but told the BBC in a statement that there had been “no wrongdoing whatsoever”. The blocks are currently operated by BP, which has said it “rejects any implication that it acted improperly in the acquisition of our interests in Senegal.” Senegal’s offshore oil and gas reserves have the potential to transform the poor West African country when they start flowing in the next decade, with volumes expected to rival some of the region’s biggest producer. The blocks, called Cayar Offshore Profond and St. Louis Profond, have caused controversy since 2012, when a previously unknown company called Petro-Tim was unexpectedly awarded the licence despite having no known track record in the industry. Soon after, the president’s brother was hired at the company. Protests against the deal erupted in the capital Dakar in 2016 during Sall’s first term. Responding to the president’s remarks on Wednesday, opposition leader Ousmane Sonko said citizens should demonstrate again. “I call on Senegalese men and women, especially the sacrificed and forgotten youth, to mobilise massively and non-stop in the coming days in protest against all the scandals ... until appropriate measures are taken,” he said in a statement.

201,2017-08-01 00:00:00,2017,8.0,1,"Karolin Schaps, Ron Bousso",BP in talks with electric carmakers on service station chargers,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP (BP.L) is in talks with electric vehicle makers on partnering to offer battery re-charging docks at its global network of fuel service stations as it seeks to benefit from the move away from diesel and petrol cars, Chief Executive Bob Dudley told Reuters on Tuesday. The expected rapid growth in the use of electric vehicles in the coming decades is threatening oil companies’ business model as demand for some road fuels could plateau as early as the late 2020s, according to some oil company estimates. Looking to take a slice of the growing market, London-based BP is however examining different ways to get involved in the sector. “We have discussions going on with a lot of the EV manufacturers to have a tie-up with our retail network for charging,” Dudley said in an interview. Rival Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) has already launched a pilot scheme to install battery charging docks at a few of its service stations in Britain and the Netherlands. The number of electric vehicles on roads is forecast to grow significantly in the coming decades, particularly in cities, with BP estimating that there will be 100 million by 2035, up from 1.2 million in 2015. Dudley has been a vocal advocate of the oil and gas industry’s need to take part in the move away from fossil fuels toward using cleaner sources of energy in order to combat global warming. But BP, along with rivals including Shell have yet to come up with a clear plan for increasing their interests in renewable energy production such as solar and wind. “We’ll be ready for this world but we’re not going to dive in too deeply,” he said, referring to BP’s previously unsuccessful ventures into renewable energy, including solar power. BP will make investments in future technologies but these will be small percentage stakes in companies or partnering with them, he said. Dudley said BP was also studying autonomous vehicles and the potential for combining natural gas with solar power generation. Oil companies are also using venture capital funds to invest in new energy technologies. Shell, for example, announced on Tuesday an investment in a Singapore-based solar firm Sunseap Group. This year is shaping up to be pivotal for BP as it starts up the largest number of new projects in a single year and the huge series of payments made in penalties and compensation for the deadly 2010 Deepwater Horizon rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico taper off. BP’s shares rose by more than 3 percent on Tuesday to trade around 459 pence after the company reported a 10 percent rise in oil and gas production in the second quarter. The company aims to add 800,000 barrels per day of new production by the end of the decade. Dudley said that the company will remain focused on reining in spending in order to make the company profitable in “a new normal” of a $50 a barrel oil price and aimed to reduce its operating breakeven cost to $30 a barrel in order to make it resilient. BP’s first American CEO also said BP could not identify at the moment any attractive opportunities in the U.S. shale industry, where it has a smaller production interest compared with Exxon Mobil(XOM.N), Chevron (CVX.N) and Shell. “We scan and screen ops all the time and people offer things to us. They just appear expensive,” Dudley said. Meanwhile, however, BP is one of several major companies developing shale gas prospects in Argentina’s Vaca Muerta province. He also denied a recent media report that said BP was thinking of putting its entire North Sea business up for sale. “That is absolutely incorrect, we are deeply committed to the North Sea, it is one of our heartlands,” he said.

Rising crude prices and energy reforms in several Latin American nations have reinvigorated the oil majors’ appetite for a region that once imposed nationalizations, forced contract changes and strict rules for foreign investors. More companies are becoming interested in offshore prospects from Brazil to Guyana, which present potential new reserves and could diversify investment portfolios. “Our emphasis in the region right now - in terms of bidding rounds - is in Brazil and Mexico. We are also looking at Argentina, though it is still early,” Arbelaez said. Brazil will receive bids for blocks in its coveted presalt region in June, after awarding majors including Exxon Mobil Corp, BP and Royal Dutch Shell Plc offshore blocks in previous rounds in 2017 and 2018. Brazil’s government also is in negotiations with Petrobras to accept foreign investment in the remaining areas of fields assigned to the state-run oil company. The resulting blocks would be auctioned this year, along with hundreds of areas that were not awarded in previous rounds. For its part, Mexico plans to announce results in September from two onshore rounds, including its first offer of unconventional areas for foreign investment. In Colombia and Uruguay, the investors’ interest has not been as high. The Andean nation has postponed several times the offer for its Sinu-San Jacinto onshore round, while Uruguay received no bids at its third offshore auction in April. The auctions in many Latin American countries come as presidential elections this year increase the political risk because some candidates have promised to slam the brakes on reforms, revise the signed contracts or change fiscal terms. “Every country is different... (The elections) don’t change our perspective in the medium or long terms,” Arbelaez said. BP is trying to increase the number of oil projects it operates in the region, especially in Brazil. In countries including Guyana, Colombia and Suriname, the firm is seeking opportunities to participate in offshore areas. “These countries are reopening for foreign investment. We think that will benefit the countries because they will have a wider number of experienced operators and because they will be capable of better developing and marketing their resources,” he said.

204,2017-01-25 00:00:00,2017,1.0,25,Ron Bousso,Global oil demand to grow into 2040s: BP outlook,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global oil demand will keep growing into the 2040s due to higher consumption of plastic goods even as the electric vehicle fleet expands rapidly and technology revolutionizes transport, BP said in its annual Energy Outlook on Wednesday. The forecast of sustained demand growth for the fossil fuel comes as other oil companies such as Royal Dutch Shell brace for demand to plateau by the early 2030s while countries gradually shift to less-polluting energy. In its industry benchmark report, BP forecasts a significant slowing of carbon emissions, which remain well in excess of goals set by governments to fight global warming. The British oil and gas company also said current recoverable global oil supplies of around 2.6 trillion barrels are sufficient to meet demand out to 2050 twice over. The abundance of oil could set the stage for a long-term struggle between low-cost producers such as U.S. shale companies, OPEC members in the Middle East as well as Russia and more expensive offshore production in areas such as Brazil, the North Sea and Asia, BP Chief Economist Spencer Dale said. “Low-cost producers will use their competitive advantage to increase their share relative to higher-cost producers,” Dale told reporters. He would not provide a forecast for oil prices. According to BP forecasts, oil demand growth over the period is set to slow from around 1 million barrels per day to 400,000 bpd by 2035, when consumption will reach around 110 million bpd. Demand is not expected to peak before the 2040s, Dale said. Oil demand from cars will rise from around 19 million bpd in 2015 to 23 million bpd in 2035, BP said. That will come amid rapid growth in the car fleet and despite improvements in engine efficiencies and an expected 100-fold expansion in the number of electric vehicles to 100 million over the period. Under this scenario, electric vehicles would constitute 5 to 6 percent of the global car fleet. BP increased its forecast for the rise in electric vehicles by 2035 from the 70 million predicted last year due to lower battery costs and higher efficiency standards, Dale said. Technological shifts such as car sharing and self-driving vehicles that increase car usage but reduce the number of cars needed are likely to play a critical role in limiting oil demand. “If you get a combination of a very rapid increase in electric vehicles with a very rapid increase in these new technologies the numbers involved could get bigger and more significant,” Dale said. But while oil demand for transportation slows, the rapid growth of developing economies in Asia, Africa and the Middle East means consumption of plastics and fabrics manufactured using oil-based feedstock, will sustain demand growth. “Key growth isn’t to power transportation ... rather oil as an input into other products, particularly into petrochemicals and fabrics,” Dale said. BP revised down its forecast for total energy demand into 2035 by almost 1 percent relative to last year, primarily due to a revision of China’s coal demand due to slower growth prospects. BP forecasts growth in carbon emissions to slow significantly over the next 20 years from 2.1 percent per year to 0.6 percent, the slowest rate since 1965. Emissions are projected to rise 13 percent by 2035. Renewable sources of energy such as wind and solar power are expected to quadruple, with non-fossil fuels providing half of the increase in energy consumption.

206,2016-04-14 00:00:00,2016,4.0,14,Valerie Volcovici,"Six years after BP spill, U.S. sets new offshore oil safety rules","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration on Thursday unveiled new oil well control rules to prevent the kind of blowout that happened six years ago on a BP Plc (BP.L) rig in the Gulf of Mexico. The Interior Department’s Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement announced the finalized regulations, which include more stringent design requirements and operational procedures for offshore oil and gas operations. The new standards come nearly six years after a deadly explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig off the cost of Louisiana, which led to the worst oil spill of all time. The Macondo well blowout and the fire on April 20,2010 killed 11 workers. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell told reporters the rule took six years to complete because the agency wanted to understand the root cause of the disaster. “There are a number of things that went wrong,” she said. “It was important that we understood those things and the evolution of technology.” The Interior Department said it took into account industry and other stakeholder feedback since it first proposed the rule last April. To improve the “culture of safety” on oil rigs and prevent future spills or blowouts, the new rule tightens requirements for blowout preventers, well design, well control casing, cementing and sub-sea containment. It also calls for real-time monitoring, third party reviews of equipment, regular inspections and safe drilling margin requirements. The agency estimates the new rule would cost the industry $890 million over a 10-year period, but would yield $1.5 billion in benefits. Republican Louisiana Senator David Vitter slammed what he called an “overarching” rule that would “kick our oil and gas industry while it’s down.” Industry lobby group the American Petroleum Institute said it is still reviewing the document, but said technical problems in the initial proposal could cause unintended consequences if they remain. Offshore drilling has seen at least 1,066 injuries, 496 fires and explosions, 22 losses of well control, 11 big oil spills and 11 fatalities since the Deepwater Horizon accident, according to the Interior Department. Jacqueline Savitz, vice president of the ocean protection advocacy group Oceana, said the new standards were “a significant improvement over the status quo” since Congress has not passed legislation to improve offshore drilling safety but are “absolutely not sufficient to protect our oceans.” Earlier this month, a federal judge in New Orleans approved BP’s $20 billion settlement, paving the way for Gulf restoration to begin.

210,2017-08-14 00:00:00,2017,8.0,14,,Gas starts flowing from BP's new fields offshore Trinidad and Australia,"(Reuters) - BP has started producing gas from two new projects offshore Trinidad and Tobago and Australia, the company said on Monday, further boosting output that is helping the company to turn a corner after a bruising market downturn. Gas has started flowing via BP’s $2 billion Juniper gas platform offshore Trinidad and Tobago that is expected to produce around 590 million cubic feet a day (mmcfd) from the Corallita and Lantana fields, BP said. Offshore Australia, gas started flowing from the Persephone field, a project developed by Woodside Energy and of which BP owns nearly 17 percent. The field is set to contribute around 48 mmcfd net to BP, the company said. The two start-ups show BP is on track to deliver seven new projects this year, as part of a plan to bring an additional 800,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on stream by 2020. BP had previously said the new projects would help to offset impact from maintenance shutdowns in the third quarter, with production expected to be flat on the second quarter. Higher production helped to deliver forecast-beating second-quarter earnings earlier this month. It is producing oil and gas at lower costs as weaker prices have forced the industry to trim spending, with production costs falling 18 percent in the first half of the year to $7.20 a barrel.

212,2018-11-26 00:00:00,2018,11.0,26,"Luc Cohen, Marianna Parraga",Exclusive: Venezuela rejected BP bid to buy Total's stake in gas block - sources,"CARACAS/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Venezuela’s oil ministry last month turned down a proposal by BP (BP.L) to buy Total’s (TOTF.PA) stake in a promising but inactive natural gas project along the maritime border with Trinidad and Tobago, five people briefed on the matter said. BP owns the rights to the Trinidadian side of the gas play. It could have used the output from the neighboring area, the Deltana Platform’s fourth block off Venezuela’s eastern coast, to feed its growing operations on the island, said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly. The rejection highlights how Venezuela’s socialist government, often hostile to foreign companies, remains an obstacle to investment even as oil majors eye the OPEC nation’s barely tapped gas reserves to expand their liquefied natural gas (LNG) portfolios. The ministry told the parties the area’s reserves needed to be re-estimated, an argument it has used to reject other deals. Two of the people said the deal had been waiting for approval for two years. France’s Total said in a March filing that the sale of its 49 percent stake was “awaiting approval from the authorities.” Norway’s Equinor (EQNR.OL) owns the other 51 percent. An Equinor spokesman said it finished exploration drilling 10 years ago, but declined to comment on Total’s plans. Gas investment could help Venezuela, which has the world’s largest crude reserves, compensate for lack of capital for its oil industry, whose production continues plummeting amid a political and economic crisis. Venezuela’s mostly undeveloped gas reserves were 225 trillion cubic feet (TCF) at the end of 2017, compared with Trinidad’s 9.2 TCF, according to BP’s Statistical Review of World Energy. BP and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS) own stakes in all four of Trinidad’s LNG plants, known as trains. Shell, the world’s largest liquefied gas trader after buying BG Group for $52 billion, is pushing Venezuela to let it produce gas in the offshore Dragon field, close to its Hibiscus platform off Trinidad. “There’s a real shortage of gas supply in the downstream industries in Trinidad,” said Tanvir Malik, a research analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. Total’s attempt to sell comes as some Western oil firms seek to shrink their Venezuelan operations as reputational risk grows amid U.S. sanctions and corruption probes linked to government officials and state-run oil company PDVSA. Shell requested approval this year to sell its only crude asset in Venezuela to French firm Maurel & Prom. Total recently downgraded its Venezuelan projects to the lowest investment category, implying it could continue looking for buyers, two company sources said. BP declined to comment. Venezuela’s oil ministry and Total did not respond to requests for comment. Venezuelan law requires PDVSA to take a majority stake in crude oil joint ventures, but is more flexible with gas, allowing foreign firms to individually operate projects through exploration and production licenses. But ownership changes in gas projects are still subject to regulatory approval, and the government is required to provide an explanation for rejections, said Eugenio Hernández-Bretón, a partner at the Baker McKenzie law firm in Caracas. Under late socialist President Hugo Chavez, PDVSA tried to take control of prominent gas projects, including the Deltana and Mariscal Sucre offshore plays, both close to Trinidad with total estimated reserves of about 22 TCF. Neither project has yet started commercial production due to long delays stemming from lack of funds and disputes over control between PDVSA and the private companies. “It is really difficult for a foreign investor to feel comfortable with Venezuelan laws applied in practice,” Hernández-Bretón said. “We don’t have the financial resources or technical expertise for developing natural gas projects, whereas Trinidad has the expertise and the backing of foreign investors.” While once an afterthought to crude oil, Big Oil is focusing increasingly on natural gas as global demand for less carbon-intensive fuels rises and LNG facilitates international gas trading. Both Shell and BP are ramping up gas operations in Trinidad, one of the world’s top 10 gas exporters. Efforts are under way to reverse the island’s 18 percent decline in gas output in the past decade. A BP gas platform built by U.S. engineering firm McDermott International (MDR.N) in Mexico recently set sail to Trinidad, a McDermott executive told Reuters. PDVSA and Trinidad’s state gas company signed an agreement in August to allow exports from Dragon into Trinidad, without specifying how to finance the construction of a $1 billion pipeline needed to transport the gas.

The Jesuit-educated barrister, who also served as Ireland’s youngest attorney general and then youngest European Union commissioner during the 1980s, had been ill for some time, Irish broadcaster RTE reported, citing a statement from his family.  “Peter Sutherland was a statesman in every sense of the word; an Irishman, a committed European and a proud internationalist,” Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said in a statement. “He had a passion for public affairs and made a significant contribution to Ireland, Europe and the world over a number of decades.” Born in Dublin in 1946, Sutherland was appointed, at the age of 35, as the state’s most senior lawyer after little more than a decade at the bar. Four years later he was nominated as Ireland’s EU commissioner, holding the competition portfolio as the EU’s single market began to take shape. Sutherland returned from Brussels briefly in 1989 and after a stint as chairman of Allied Irish Banks he became the WTO’s first chief in 1995, having previously been head of its precursor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Praising his international contribution to business, politics and human rights, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Sunday described Sutherland as “a giant of Irish, European and international public life”. A spokesman for the WTO said that Sutherland’s leadership, vision and courage were instrumental in the birth of the world trade body and that the lengthy Uruguay Round negotiations that led to its creation were by no means assured until the Irishman took charge. While spearheading the WTO, Sutherland took up his roles at Goldman Sachs and BP. He was the oil major’s longest-serving chairman, from 1997 to 2009, and held that role even longer at Goldman Sachs International, retiring in 2015 after 20 years in the job. A passionate advocate of globalization and the EU and one of Ireland’s best known public figures on the international stage, Sutherland continued in his role as United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General for International Migration until close to his death. “He leaves an important legacy through his work as Secretary-General, having brought the importance of migration to the forefront of public thought and policy,” Irish President Michael D. Higgins said in a statement.

The Clair Ridge project is the second phase of the Clair field, located 75 km (47 miles) west of Shetlands. Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips also hold stakes in the field. In addition to two bridge-linked platforms, the Clair Ridge project included a new oil and gas pipeline tying it to the Clair export pipeline, which delivers oil to the onshore Sullom Voe terminal, BP said in a statement. Clair was first discovered in 1977 and is one of a number of big developments in the West of Shetland area, where other oil companies are investing. The new project is designed to recover 640 million barrels of oil. Clair Ridge is BP’s sixth major project start-up in 2018, after starting up seven in 2017. All these projects will boost the London-based company’s output by 900,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021. British Energy Minister Claire Perry said in a statement that Clair Ridge was vital for the country’s energy security. “Aided by the innovative use of technology developed in the UK and a strong UK-based supply chain worth £1.5 billion, this will allow the North Sea to continue to be a hub for the high-skilled, well-paid jobs at the center of our modern Industrial Strategy.” Reporting by Ron Bousso; Editing by Edmund Blair and Emelia Sithole-Matarise",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bp-clairridge/bp-starts-production-at-clair-ridge-field-in-north-sea-idUSKCN1NS0TL,Commodities,Reuters

The company said it will record an after-tax charge of around $2.5 billion in its second quarter as a result of the latest charge. This comes more than a year after the British oil and gas company agreed to pay up to $18.7 billion in penalties to the U.S. government and five states to resolve most claims from the spill in the largest corporate settlement in U.S. history. The company said in a statement on Thursday that the $5.2 billion charge would mark the last major claim and that any further claims would not have a material impact, drawing the Deepwater Horizon incident near a close. “Over the past few months we’ve made significant progress resolving outstanding Deepwater Horizon claims and today we can estimate all the material liabilities remaining from the incident,” Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary said. BP launched a vast divestment programme following the spill and plans to sell more assets in the coming years in order to cover costs. The rig explosion on April 20, 2010, the worst offshore oil disaster in U.S. history, killed 11 workers and spewed millions of barrels of oil onto the shorelines of several states for nearly three months. BP said in October it would pay more than $20 billion in fines to resolve nearly all claims from the spill, and estimated that pretax charges related to the spill at $53.8 billion.

The move represents a big bet by BP on U.S. oil and gas production at a time when energy prices are rebounding. It would allow it to significantly rebalance its business with oil production, after focusing largely on natural gas assets. BP is the front-runner in the auction for the assets run by BHP, and could reach a deal in coming weeks, the sources added, cautioning that an agreement is not certain and it is possible that negotiations could end unsuccessfully. The exact terms and composition of BP’s offer could not be learned. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. BP and BHP did not immediately respond to requests for comment. BHP said in August it aimed to sell onshore shale assets in the Eagle Ford, Permian, Haynesville and Fayetteville basins, which it acquired at the height of the oil boom. It had come under pressure from activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp to do so. The acreage for sale includes holdings that BHP acquired in its $12-billion takeover of Petrohawk Energy in 2011, which have declined rapidly in value as the price of natural gas has fallen from $4.50 at the time of the deal to a low of $1.60 last year. In 2015, BP began operating its onshore U.S. business as a separate entity to make it more competitive. Since then, BP has expanded the business to include acreage in the Haynesville and Bossier shale plays near the Texas–Louisiana border. However, BP’s expansion in U.S. shale fell behind many of it peers. When others were building out their presence onshore, BP’s focus was on the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil-spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, which has forced it to pay tens of billions of dollars in damages and restitution since 2010. If completed, the acquisition of BHP’s acreage would be transformational for BP’s unit, adding oil-rich wells in the Permian and Eagle Ford basins of Texas. Other oil majors that participated in the auction for the assets include Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N), sources have said.

BP, which plans to lay off around 7,000 workers by the end of next year, said it was expecting further charges related to redundancies and other restructuring measures next year, adding to the $2.1 billion in charges incurred since the end of 2014. BP’s third-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, the company’s definition of net income, fell to $933 million from $1.8 billion a year earlier but beat the $780 million expected by analysts. “We remain on track to rebalance organic cash flows next year at $50 to $55 a barrel,” Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary said in a statement. Oil prices are now trading at around $49 a barrel, meaning BP is banking on a slight rise in prices going into next year. To achieve a leaner balance sheet, BP said it would lower its 2016 capital expenditure to around $16 billion from the $17-19 billion expected at the start of the year, and target $15-17 billion for 2017. BP joined the ranks of Shell, France’s Total and U.S. majors Exxon Mobil and Chevron in beating expectations, with cost cuts helping to improve margins.

222,2019-03-21,2019,3.0,21,Alison Frankel,5th Circuit nixes ex-NBA star’s $1.5 mln BP spill claim - because he didn't lose any money,"Remember a few years back when the oil company BP was desperately trying to wriggle out of its own class action settlement with purported victims of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill? BP contended that settlement administrators had misconstrued the terms of the deal and were signing off on millions of dollars of unwarranted claims. The oil company brought in Gibson Dunn & Crutcher and conducted an ad blitz portraying itself as the victim of vulturous plaintiffs' lawyers, but it was all for naught. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and then the U.S. Supreme Court refused to undo the settlement. The appeals court even refused  in 2014 to revisit the trial court’s interpretation of the settlement, which, according to BP, made it all too easy for people to collect undeserved claims. On Wednesday, however, the 5th Circuit said it had finally met a BP claim it could not abide. Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast. The appeals court nixed a $1.5 million award to ex-NBA All Star David West, who was in the fourth year of a five-year, $45 million contract with the New Orleans Hornets when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in 2010. West was paid every penny of the $45 million he was owed under his contract, including the full amount he was due in the year after the spill. He nevertheless argued – and the settlement administrator agreed – that under the definitions and formulas in BP settlement, he qualified for a payout for economic losses because he earned less in 2010 than in 2009. The 5th Circuit shut that right down. West earned less in the year after the spill, the appeals court said, because he had signed a front-loaded contract that paid him more in the early part of his deal than at the end. “West did not suffer actual and unexpected ‘losses’ or damages,” wrote Judge Andrew Oldham for a panel that also included Judge Edith Jones and Catharina Haynes. “In 2010, he earned exactly what he was entitled to receive under his contract. The fact that West received less money in 2010 than in 2009 does not mean he ‘lost’ anything or was ‘damaged’ in any way. It means only he agreed to a frontloaded contract. And he did so many years before the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe.” Judge Haynes said West’s claim could most generously be described as “implausible,” in a concurrence in which she said West claims should be remanded to the trial court rather than rejected outright. You’re probably wondering how West’s lawyers from Barrasso Usdin Kupperman Freeman & Sarver could possibly justify a $1.5 million demand from a multimillionaire who was paid all that he was due under his contract in the year after the Deepwater Horizon spill. The answer lies in the structure of the BP settlement. As West’s counsel explained in their brief to the 5th Circuit, employees of the Hornets (now renamed the Pelicans) were designated to be eligible for economic damages under the BP settlement because the team was considered a “tourism industry business” affected by the oil spill. West was indisputably a Hornets employee – and he indisputably earned less in the year after the storm, as he proved in documents submitted with his claim. Ergo, according to his lawyers, he was entitled to payment from BP – which is why his claim was approved by the settlement administrator and left intact by U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier of New Orleans, who oversees the BP case. Any contrary arguments by the oil company, West contended, were simply another BP attempt to rewrite the settlement agreement. That contention is pure chutzpah, according to BP, and from a guy so rich that in 2015 he forewent a $12.6 million option when he left the Indiana Pacers to play for the San Antonio Spurs. BP’s lead lawyer, Lisa Blatt of Williams & Connolly argued in the company’s appellate brief that the settlement agreement may not require oil spill victims to provide evidence linking their economic losses to the oil spill but it does demand that claimants attest they suffered economic harm as a result of the spill. West suffered no economic loss as a consequence of the spill, BP said, so the attestation he submitted with his claim was “patently false.” “West does not dispute that he received exactly the post-spill earnings set forth in his lucrative pre-spill contract,” BP told the 5th Circuit. “The settlement agreement compensates individuals and businesses for actual losses. It was not designed to pay individuals for a dip in compensation dictated exclusively by a long-established contract.” The appeals court did not go so far as to accuse West of filing a false declaration claiming economic losses, but the judges agreed that his theory – that he has a claim because he earned less after the spill than before it – “puts the cart before the horse.” To invoke the claim process, the 5th Circuit said, you have to have suffered a loss. West didn’t, so, according to the appeals court, he can’t recover from BP. “West expected to earn in the absence of the spill precisely what he did earn after it,” the opinion said. “He therefore did not suffer unexpected damages.” Amen to that. I emailed West counsel Stephen Kupperman of the Barrasso firm but didn’t hear back. BP counsel Blatt had no comment.

223,2017-06-07,2017,6.0,7,Valerie Volcovici,U.S. Gulf Coast groups concerned as Trump picks BP lawyer to top DOJ post,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s selection of Jeffrey Bossert Clark to be the Justice Department’s top environmental lawyer has raised concerns by Gulf coast environmental groups as he was the lawyer for international oil company BP Plc in the aftermath of the company’s 2010 drilling rig explosion. Trump named Clark on Wednesday to be Assistant Attorney General for environment at the Department of Justice, representing the U.S. government on environmental regulation and enforcement issues. Clark, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis, represented BP after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion and Macondo oil well rupture that killed 11 workers and caused the largest offshore environmental disaster in U.S. history. The accident polluted large parts of the Gulf, killing marine wildlife and harming businesses. Along the U.S. Gulf coast, local communities are still grappling with cleanup and restoration, and had relied on the federal government and EPA to protect them against climate change and oil and gas company accidents, said Cynthia Sarthou, director of the Gulf Restoration Network in Louisiana. “I think the enforcement of any pollution laws is going to be at risk right now,” Sarthou said. “Bossert (Clark) is unlikely to hold the oil and gas industry accountable for pollution.” Sarthou added that most of the oil and gas infrastructure along the U.S. Gulf coast is aging, putting local environmental groups on alert for future accidents. “While this administration continues to choose profits over people, South Louisiana residents continue to struggle to recover from the economic, health and environmental impacts of the BP oil drilling disaster,” said Colette Pichon Battle, of the Human Rights Network, a lawyer who represented local communities affected by the BP accident. According to a White House statement, Clark is a “complex trial and appellate litigator with especially deep experience in administrative law.” In addition to practicing law in private practice, he also served worked as deputy assistant attorney general for environment at the Justice department from 2001 to 2005. As an attorney, Clark also represented industry groups in several challenges against the previous administration’s Environmental Protection Agency. This includes a lawsuit to revoke the “endangerment finding,” the scientific finding that gives the agency authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and one to challenge California’s ability to set its own stringent greenhouse gas emission standards for vehicles.

225,2017-06-27,2017,6.0,27,,"RPT-INSIGHT-In disaster's wake, BP doubles down on deepwater despite surging shale","(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Jessica Resnick-Ault THUNDER HORSE OIL PLATFORM, Gulf of Mexico, June 27 (Reuters) - A bout 300 BP workers commute 150 miles here by helicopter, from the Louisiana coast to a deep-sea drilling platform that can produce more oil in a day than a West Texas rig can pump in a year. On the deck of Thunder Horse, they work two-week shifts, drink seawater from a desalination plant, and eat ribs and chicken ferried in by boat. On the ocean floor, robots provide remote eyes and arms as drills extract up to 265,000 barrels per day. “There’s a whole city below us,” said Jim Pearl, Marine Team Leader on the platform. This is just one of the four Gulf of Mexico platforms on which BP has staked its future in U.S. oil production. Seven years after its Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill, BP is betting tens of billions of dollars on the prospect that it can slash the costs of offshore drilling by half or more - just as shale oil producers have done onshore. The firm says it can do that while it continues to pay an estimated $61 billion in total costs and damages from the worst spill in history - and without compromising safety. BP’s Gulf platforms are key to a global strategy calling for up to $17 billion in annual investments through 2021 to increase production by about 5 percent each year, Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley recently told investors. “Our strategy is to take this investment that we spent so much money building, and keep it full” to the platform’s capacity, Richard Morrison, BP’s regional president for the Gulf of Mexico, told Reuters during the first tour of a BP Gulf drilling platform since the disaster. “We’re also exploring for larger pools of oil.” BP’s deepwater double-down is all the more striking for the contrast to its chief competitors, who have cooled on offshore investments in light of the lower costs and quicker returns of onshore shale plays. While BP has some onshore U.S. developments, the firm is notably absent from the industry’s rush into shale oil fields of the West Texas Permian Basin. Majors including Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell have maintained Gulf operations but focused expansions on U.S. shale. Exxon Mobil doubled its acreage in the Permian in a deal earlier this year. Freeport-McMoRan and Devon Energy Corp have pulled out of Gulf drilling entirely in recent years. Anadarko Petroleum Corp took a $435-million dollar write-down in May on its Shenandoah project in the Gulf, deciding it could not profit with oil prices hovering at about $50 a barrel. “In a $50 to $60 world, we always felt like greenfield development, in the Gulf in particular, was fairly challenged,” Anadarko CEO Al Walker told investors last month. Oil prices dropped steeply last week, settling in the low $40s per barrel. BP says its next Gulf development - the $9 billion Mad Dog phase two - would be profitable even at $40 a barrel. As recently as 2013, BP reported that it could not start new deepwater Gulf projects at prices lower than $100 a barrel. In time, BP’s offshore expansion could produce a huge payoff. The firm announced last month that it had discovered an additional billion barrels of oil below its four audaciously named Gulf platforms - Thunder Horse, Atlantis, Na Kika and Mad Dog. The find - worth more than $40 billion at today’s market prices - amounts to more than three times the proven reserves at the Na Kika field, or the equivalent of three new fields in the Gulf. “It seems like every ten years there’s another breakthrough” that unlocks more Gulf oil, Morrison said on the deck of Thunder Horse. Over his shoulder, a drillship three miles away tapped a new well that will feed production into the massive platform. In the wake of the 2010 BP disaster, deepwater production was curtailed by a six-month U.S. government moratorium on drilling and a longer period of uncertainty about regulation. But output has rebounded to new record highs as projects sanctioned years ago start operations and existing hubs such as Thunder Horse expand. BP’s big new discovery is key to its slashing of estimated per-barrel costs, as are a host of drilling innovations and more favorable deals with service providers. For eight decades, geologists have used seismic imaging to estimate oil and gas reserves beneath the rocky undersea terrain. BP used its own new technology for the billion-barrel discovery. Called full waveform inversion, the technique uses massive amounts of data to create a high-resolution model of reserves that were previously hidden beneath salt deposits. The firm also aims to tap those reserves without building new multi-billion-dollar platforms. At Thunder Horse and other platforms, BP is installing wellheads on the seabed and connecting them to pipelines that rise up to existing platforms, like the legs of a spider. These “tiebacks” allow producers to feed oil from remote regions of fields that previously went untapped. Other design changes helped BP hold down the investment in Mad Dog’s second phase from an initially estimated $20 billion to just $9 billion, the company said. Such savings are part of the equation BP uses to estimate the platform’s profitability at oil prices of $40 a barrel. The struggles of deepwater oil service firms - who were forced to cut prices after per-barrel prices tanked in 2014 - are also keeping BP’s expansion costs low. “If you’re going to be building an offshore Gulf of Mexico platform, now is the time to be doing it,” said Norm MacDonald, portfolio manager for Invesco’s energy fund, which has increased its stake in BP, its second-largest holding. Other funds remain leery of offshore investments because of the longer wait for a return in a volatile industry. Shale has a “liquidity premium” because producers can make smaller investments and recoup them sooner, within two or three years, said Michael Roomberg, a portfolio analyst at Miller-Howard Investments. Tie-backs and other advances, however, could accelerate deepwater returns and help narrow the liquidity gap with shale, MacDonald said. BP’s growing deepwater investments irk some environmentalists, who say the company has fought paying what it owes to restore shorelines and communities damaged by its massive spill. They also see the threat of another disaster. “They never really fulfilled those promises, and people are very skeptical about them expanding drilling,” said Raleigh Hoke, campaign director at Gulf Restoration Network in New Orleans. Richard Sears - who served as chief scientist on the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling - said such projects can be managed safely at low oil prices. The causes of the BP disaster had more to do with poor decision-making and slipshod safety systems than cost-cutting, said Sears, who previously managed production projects at Shell. BP said it has bolstered safety operations globally since the spill, introducing a safety and operational risk staff with 800 positions and an internal global wells organization to standardize drilling practices, among other measures. The company says it cannot precisely estimate new spending on safety since the spill because its efforts are integrated into many parts of the company. In a glassed-in drilling shack on the Thunder Horse platform, operators stay connected to a new onshore command center in Houston that BP designed to monitor data from offshore wells. On the deck below sits a blowout preventer, a room-sized piece of equipment that would soon be fitted on the wellhead of a drilling site, two miles under water. But first it would need a safety inspection - unlike the blowout preventer that infamously failed to contain the 2010 spill, which federal regulators have said had not been inspected in years.

226,2016-10-11,2016,10.0,11,Ariel Bogle,BP abandons plans for marine oil field to rival 'the Gulf of Mexico',"In a victory for environmentalists, oil giant BP announced Tuesday it would not proceed with its plans to drill in the Great Australian Bight. It was a significant reversal for the company, which had once suggested the region could become an oil field to rival the Gulf of Mexico, the Guardian reported. ""That territory could be something like the Niger Delta or Mississippi Delta, so it's of interest to the world, not just Australia and BP,"" head of BP Australia Andy Holmes told the Australian in 2014. The Great Australian Bight is located off the south coast of Australia. It's home to threatened species such as the Australian sea lion and blue whale as well as industries such as tourism and fishing that rely on a pristine marine environment. BP was awarded exploration licences for the region in 2011. BP claimed the backdown was decided for business reasons. ""We have looked long and hard at our exploration plans for the Great Australian Bight but, in the current external environment, we will only pursue frontier exploration opportunities if they are competitive and aligned to our strategic goals,"" Claire Fitzpatrick, BP's Managing Director for Exploration and Production in Australia, said in a statement.  ""After extensive and careful consideration, this has proven not to be the case for our project to explore in the Bight."" Australian Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, who had been outspoken against the project, greeted the news on Twitter.  Breaking: BP drops their push to drill for oil in the Great Aust Bight.

Community (1), Big Oil (0) — Sarah Hanson-Young (@sarahinthesen8) October 11, 2016 According to the Guardian, Australia's offshore oil regulator, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (NOPSEMA), had made requests for more detail about BP's plans in the Bight in recent months. NOPSEMA said in a statement Tuesday the environmental plans submitted by BP remained under assessment: ""NOPSEMA has not received a withdrawal request."" In a statement, Wilderness Society national director Lyndon Schneiders suggested BP's failure to satisfy NOPSEMA should be a warning to other companies hoping to drill in the area.  ""This decision shows that it's too expensive to establish the significant and costly risk management and clean up capacity infrastructure needed to protect our communities from the enormous spill risks,"" he said. ""We call on these companies to follow BP’s lead and leave the Bight, and the communities surrounding the Bight, in peace."" Modelling commissioned by the Wilderness Society, as well as BP itself, suggested oil from a spill would reach the coast.  The Australian Youth Climate Coalition (AYCC), which had been a part of protests against BP's project, welcomed the news Tuesday. ""This was the biggest new proposed fossil fuel project in the country, if it went ahead it would fuel dangerous global warming and risk a safe climate,"" Amy Gordon, AYCC national campaigner, told Mashable in an email. ""International oil companies, Chevron and Statoil still have plans to drill for oil in the Bight, but they should look to BP who cited the fact the lack of financial value in the project as the main reason they were walking away,"" she added. ""Drilling in the Great Australian Bight is too expensive for oil companies and is too expensive for our climate."" The AYCC also called for Prime Minister Turnbull to ban all oil drilling in the Great Australian Bight.  Karoon Gas Australia is one of a number of companies that have also been approved to drill in the region, the Guardian reported.  On Friday, it announced it had been granted a permit to explore 17,793 square kilometres of the Great Australian Bight, or what it called ""Australia's most active and prospective frontier oil exploration province."" ""Karoon recognizes the GAB is a pristine wilderness and an iconic Australian coastline with significant environmental and commercial fishing sensitivities. The eastern portion of the Permit includes a Commonwealth marine reserve running through it,"" Karoon acknowledged in its statement. ""The Great Australian Bight waters are deeper, more treacherous and more remote than the Gulf of Mexico, where BP was responsible for 800 million litres of oil spewing into the Gulf for 87 days in 2010,"" Wilderness Society South Australia director Peter Owen added. ""It’s time to end the dangerous fiasco of oil and gas exploration in the Great Australian Bight.""

228,2017-03-29,2017,3.0,29,"Ron Bousso, Dmitry Zhdannikov",BP sees trading benefits from oil boom in the Americas,"LONDON (Reuters) - Oil major BP (BP.L) expects its trading operations to benefit from growing global crude trade on the back of abundant U.S., Canadian and Brazilian production and rising energy demand in Asia, a top BP executive said. Tufan Erginbilgic, the head of BP’s downstream division that includes one of the world’s most powerful trading desks, told Reuters he wanted to expand BP’s trading activities using long-term deals on third-party oil and products. U.S. shale oil production using fracking technology has turned the world’s largest oil consumer into an exporter of crude and products, while Canada is developing its vast oil sands deposits and Brazil is developing huge offshore fields. “There will be more flows in the world because where crude production will increase is the U.S., Canada, Brazil, and refining will increase in Asia and the Middle East,” Erginbilgic told Reuters in an interview. “We are not shy of optimizing the opportunities in any of our businesses,” he said when asked if BP planned to expand its trading operations as flows increased. BP, which employs about 1,800 people in oil trading, trades over 5 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil and refined products, and is only exceeded by rival Royal Dutch/Shell and trading house Vitol. The trading unit does not normally disclose results separately from the downstream business, which includes refining and petrochemical production. But industry experts estimate trading profits can be more than $1 billion in a good year. But, in an unusual move, BP said its oil trading had a loss in the fourth quarter of 2016 partly due to a $70 million lawsuit claim related to a cargo for a Moroccan refinery. It coincided with an oil price rally after OPEC announced plans to cut output. “Our supply and trading is more about physical barrels than people realize,” said Erginbilgic, referring to a common market perception that BP trades heavily on paper positions. He also said BP wanted to expand its long-term deals to trade on crude and products from third-parties. “We like our (BP) flows, but we are not limited by them,” he said. The world is becoming saturated with barrels of light crude from U.S. shale producers, while cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are reducing flows of the heavier grades that OPEC states mostly produce. This benefits Atlantic basin refineries that are less sophisticated than modern Asian and Middle Eastern plants, which can deal with heavy and more complex grades of crude, said Erginbilgic. This should boost prices of heavier fuel oil. “At some point, fuel oil will have to strengthen in this equation because people will need fuel oil to fill the cokers,” he said, referring to units that deal with heavier residual crudes in the refining process. But he said fuel oil gains were unlikely to hold for long due to new marine fuel regulations requiring the use of fuel with a lower sulfur content than fuel oil and encouraging usage of middle distillates from 2020. Middle distillates are lighter. “Distillates will strengthen in the process at least early on,” said Erginbilgic, adding that new refineries being built in Asia and the Middle East would help meet new marine fuel demand. He said global demand for distillates was poised to grow faster than gasoline. “Given the complexity of our refineries we are well positioned,” said Erginbilgic, adding that 47 percent of output from BP’s plants was distillates while less than 3 percent was high sulfur fuel oil. BP has said it does not plan to build new refineries but will modernize existing ones. Erginbilgic, who has run BP’s downstream division since 2014, said he was ensuring that the trading business worked more closely with refining to generate profits. “We brought together supply and trading and refining, they make decisions in the regions together. That allows you to optimize the pie,” he said. Writing by Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Edmund Blair",http://www.reuters.com/article/bp-refining-trading-idUSL5N1H44ZF,Business News,Reuters

232,2018-06-29,2018,6.0,29,"Chen Aizhu, Florence Tan",BP holds millions of barrels of oil off China as demand falters,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Four supertankers chartered by energy major BP have been held up or delayed off China’s east coast over the last two months, unable to fully discharge oil as slowing demand from the country’s private refiners starts to impact global markets. Two of the four BP-chartered very large crude carriers (VLCCs) are still off Shandong province holding half their cargoes of Angolan crude oil, and another is headed back there from South Korea, according to trade flow data in Thomson Reuters Eikon and two shipping sources who track these vessels. It’s not clear why the tankers have had so much trouble offloading all their oil, or if BP had first secured buyers for the 8 million barrels - worth more than $600 million at current market prices - that was loaded onto the vessels out of Africa. BP has declined to comment on the matter. What is apparent is that the fortunes of China’s independent refiners, often called “teapots”, have turned for the worse amid escalating global trade tensions, rising crude oil prices, an oversupplied domestic fuel market and tighter government tax scrutiny. “Either it’s because of lower run rates curbing teapots’ buying, or the buyers are having problems paying,” said an executive with a western trading house. While an executive at an independent Shandong refiner said: “The market is bad - weak demand as plants come under policy headwinds ... (with) the tax rules biting into margins.” Both executives declined to be named as they were not authorized to speak publicly about commercial operations. (GRAPHIC: China diesel & gasoline exports - reut.rs/2yc8UF2) It is not unusual for producers like BP to ship cargoes before finding a buyer. But having cargoes orphaned for two months is less common, several oil traders and shippers said. Paying for supertankers, each half a kilometer (0.3 miles) long, to wait in open seas to unload is costly as well. Although it is not known at what rate BP chartered the four vessels, shippers estimate the daily charter rate for a VLCC is now about $30,000 a day. So, four chartered VLCCs sitting idle for a month would cost BP around $3.6 million. BP declined to comment on the cost of having the tankers waiting off China to unload oil. Several traders and shippers said BP was unlikely the only seller caught off guard by the slowdown in demand and the teapots’ troubles, although all said stranded cargoes of this size and duration is rare. Among the four BP-chartered ships, the Texas has been held up the longest. It discharged part of its Angolan crude load in mid-April at Qingdao and was slated to offload the rest of its cargo at Rizhao, another port in Shandong, shortly after. Instead, the Texas has been anchored off the coast until this week, when it discharged 130,000 tonnes on Thursday, according to a port source with knowledge of the matter. Another VLCC, the Olympic Light, has been floating near Qingdao after discharging part of its cargo on May 12, and may now be heading to the port to discharge the rest of its crude. The Mercury Hope, a third VLCC, has been looking for a home for its remaining cargo after it discharged part of it at Qingdao in late May. A fourth VLCC, Olympic Luck, planned to deliver crude to Qingdao in early May but turned away and transferred half of its cargo this week to a smaller tanker off Nagasaki, Japan, and then sailed toward South Korea.

233,2019-06-03,2019,6.0,3,Ron Bousso,BP agrees to sell Egyptian oil assets to Dubai's Dragon Oil,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP said on Monday it had agreed to sell its interests in the Gulf of Suez oil concessions in Egypt to Dubai-based Dragon Oil for an undisclosed sum. Under the terms of the agreement, Dragon Oil will purchase producing and exploration concessions, including BP’s interest in the Gulf of Suez Petroleum Company (GUPCO). Reuters reported last month that London-based BP was nearing the sale of the Egyptian assets to Dragon Oil for over $600 million, citing industry and banking sources. The deal, which is subject to the Egyptian Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources’ approval, is expected to complete during the second half of 2019, BP said in a statement. It is part of BP’s plan to divest over $10 billion over the next 2 years, it said, but the deal’s financial details were not disclosed. The sale comes as BP focuses its operations on Egypt’s vast offshore gas reserves. In February, BP launched the Giza/Fayoum field in the West Nile Delta offshore area which is expected to produce around 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. BP’s total net production in Egypt reached 49,000 bpd of oil and gas liquids and 878 million cubic feet per day of gas in 2018, according to its 2018 annual report. “Egypt is a core growth and investment region for BP,” Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said in a statement. “In the past four years we have invested around $12 billion in Egypt – more than anywhere else in our portfolio –– and we plan another $3 billion investment over the next two years,” Dudley said.

235,2018-10-08,2018,10.0,8,"Ahmad Ghaddar, Ron Bousso",Eni to acquire half of BP's Libya oil and gas assets,"LONDON (Reuters) - Italy’s Eni has agreed to buy half of BP’s 85 percent stake in a Libyan oil and gas license with the aim of resuming exploration next year, the companies said on Monday. Eni will acquire the 42.5 percent stake and become the operator of the exploration and production sharing agreement (EPSA) in Libya, in which the Libyan Investment Authority holds the remaining 15 percent, the companies said in a statement. The companies, along with state-owned National Oil Corp (NOC), signed a letter of intent in London on Monday paving the way for the final deal. They did not disclose financial terms of the transaction. NOC chairman Mustafa Sanalla said the agreement showed renewed confidence in the war-torn country’s oil and gas sector. “This agreement is a clear signal and recognition by the market of the opportunities Libya has to offer and will only serve to strengthen our production outlook,” he said. BP Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley hailed the deal as an important step “towards returning to our work in Libya”. “We believe that working closely together with Eni and with Libya will allow us to bring forward restarting exploration in these promising areas,” he said in the statement. The resumption of exploration would help boost Libya’s oil and gas output which fell sharply in the years following a civil war that started in 2011, Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi said. Libya is producing around 1.25 million barrels of oil per day (bopd), still below its pre-civil war capacity of 1.6 million bpd. BP does not produce any oil or gas in Libya. It signed the EPSA agreement in 2007 to explore onshore in the Ghadames basin and offshore in the Sirte basin. Its exploration program was interrupted in 2011 when the civil war broke out and remains under force majeure. In 2015, the company wrote off $432 million from its Libyan activities. Eni, which has been operating in Libya since 1959, is currently active in six contract areas in Libya and its production in 2017 reached a record 384,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The EPSA includes two onshore areas in the Ghadames basin and one in the offshore Sirte basin, covering a total area of around 54,000 square kilometers.

236,2018-03-13,2018,3.0,13,Devika  Krishna Kumar,BP expects strong compliance for marine sulfur emissions caps,"NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Oil major BP Plc expects more than 90 percent of the world’s shipping fleet will comply with new regulations slashing sulfur levels ships are allowed to burn starting 2020, a company executive said on Tuesday. Coming International Maritime Organization (IMO) rules will cut the amount of sulfur emissions that ships worldwide are allowed from 3.5 percent to 0.5 percent by 2020. “Potential non-compliance is a significant issue that the market has been contending with,” Jason Breslaw, who leads BP’s distillate trading origination across the Americas, said at an industry conference in New Orleans. Breslaw said BP expects only about 9 percent of the industry is likely to be non-compliant as the rule takes effect. The compliance level has significant implications for demand for high-sulfur fuel oil; BP’s estimates fall well short of other analyst estimates of about 30 percent non-compliance. The IMO has said there would be no delays or exceptions to the coming rules, whether or not the industry takes the steps it needs to comply, and warned that all parties face consequences if they do not play their part. Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie estimates about 30 percent non-compliance, said Alan Gelder, vice president of refining, chemicals and oil markets. “At the moment nobody is really doing anything ... with a number of the shippers playing chicken with the regulator, does the regulator blink? We don’t know,” Gelder told Reuters. One way ships can comply with coming standards is to retrofit vessels with costly scrubbers, which can reduce sulfur emissions even if ships continue to burn dirty fuel. But there are significant concerns with this process as well, industry participants said. The cost of installing scrubbers is about $3 million to $10 million, said Anil Rajguru, vice president of process safety at Fluor Corp. “Right now less than 500 ships have scrubbers. We’re talking more like 50,000 and it could take more than a decade before scrubbers are fitted on (all) the vessels,” Rajguru said.

238,2016-06-29,2016,6.0,29,,BP receives its first Venezuelan crude cargo under swap deal,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Britain’s BP Plc this month received a Venezuelan crude cargo from state-run PDVSA, according to Thomson Reuters trade flows data, the first since the companies agreed on a swap arrangement to settle pending payments for U.S. oil shipments. BP and China Oil won a tender launched by PDVSA in March to be supplied with U.S. and African light oil during the second quarter of this year. The light oil is needed to dilute Venezuela’s extra heavy output and for processing at Caribbean refineries. After cash-strapped PDVSA did not make payments on time, BP in May halted further discharges of cargoes of U.S. crude at the port of Curacao. Then a swap agreement was reached involving deliveries of Venezuelan oil to BP as payment for the U.S. crude, a source close to the talks said earlier in June. Aframax tanker Grimstad, chartered by BP and carrying some 500,000 barrels of Venezuelan Merey crude, arrived in Pascagoula Anchorage and Lightering Area in the U.S. Gulf Coast on June 11. It has been waiting to discharge since then. BP has not had access to Venezuelan crude since 2013, when its unit TNK-BP sold its stake in a crude upgrader at the Orinoco belt to Russia’s Rosneft. BP still needs to receive more cargoes from PDVSA to cover all payments it is owed and this is why several BP tankers have still yet to unload in Curacao, according to traders. As of June 29, 2.05 million barrels of U.S. crude in three tankers are still waiting to unload, while a fourth cargo entered PDVSA’s Bullenbay terminal in Curacao this week to start delivering. A unit of Russia’s oil company Lukoil has also been importing cargoes of Venezuelan crude in the United States since late 2015 under a similar swap agreement with PDVSA.

Marathon took over the 459,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery in Texas City, Texas, and terminals when the transaction closed on Feb. 1, 2013, and began finding problems that breached the sale agreement, according to the lawsuit. “After assuming operation of the refinery, Marathon Petroleum discovered that, in numerous respects, the refinery and the terminals were not in compliance with environmental laws,” according to the lawsuit. BP also failed to maintain process safety information on 3,756 pressure vessels at the refinery, Marathon alleged. BP began a project in 2010 to compile the process safety information on the pressure vessels, “but it abandoned this project in April 2012 having only completed documentation for 555 of the vessels,” according to the lawsuit. Marathon also said BP planned to carry out an overhaul of an aromatics recovery unit prior to the sale being complete, but did not do so after signing the sale agreement, according to the lawsuit. Marathon also wants to terminate payments, as of July 31, 2016, it has been making to BP for servicing retail stations Marathon received as part of the sale, according to the suit. The BP Texas City refinery was the site of a March 23, 2005, explosion that killed 15 workers and injured 180 others. BP was fined $84.6 million by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration between 2005 and 2012 for safety rules violations found at the refinery in investigations following the blast. BP pleaded guilty to a federal environmental law violation and paid $50 million to the U.S. Justice Department in 2009. BP also paid more than $2 billion to settle lawsuits stemming from the 2005 explosion.

Militants attacked the In Salah gas plant, operated with state-owned Sonatrach, with rockets on Friday, causing no casualties or damage. Al Qaeda’s North Africa branch claimed responsibility for the attack. Algeria’s energy infrastructure has been heavily protected by the army, especially since a 2013 attack on the In Amenas gas plant, also operated by BP and Statoil, during which 40 oil workers were killed. “BP has decided to undertake a phased temporary relocation of all its staff from the In Salah Gas and In Amenas JVs in Algeria over the next two weeks. This decision has been taken as a precautionary measure,” the British firm said in a statement. Statoil said it would also withdraw staff from the In Salah and In Amenas plants, together with staff from its operations center at Hassi Messaoud. “It will happen over the next few weeks. Those who are on rotation now will not be replaced when they finish their shifts,” a Statoil spokesman said, declining to say for security reasons how many employees would be affected. “It’s only been four days since shots were fired at In Salah. The production started again, but in the current situation we believe that this is the right decision to make,” the spokesman added. Sonatrach workers were maintaining gas output after BP and Statoil announced they would pull out some of their staff, a Sonatrach source told Reuters on Monday. According to BP’s website, In Salah started production in 2004 from the Krechba, Teguentour and Reg fields. In February, it announced the start up of development of the Gour Mahmoud, In Salah, Garet el Befinat and Hassi Moumene fields, to bring output to 9 billion cubic meters a year. Statoil, BP and Sonatrach were due to restart the third and final processing train at the In Amenas gas plant, damaged during the 2013 attack, later this year. Statoil repeated on Monday the restart of that train would still happen “in the coming months”.

The company said Friday that it would support a resolution from activist investors that calls on BP to align its goals with the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to keep global warming ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius. The resolution is from Climate Action 100+, a group of 300 investors with $32 trillion in assets. It will be voted on at the company's annual meeting in May. The group writes in the resolution that action was needed because BP ""has not yet demonstrated"" that its strategy is consistent with the Paris goals.  The resolution includes specific pledges.  BP (BP) will consider whether new investments are consistent with the Paris deal. That includes exploration projects, acquisitions, technological investments and the development of existing oil and gas fields. The company will set climate targets related to its own operations, and it will publish an annual review of its progress. BP also said that 36,000 of its workers will see their bonuses linked to greenhouse gas emissions reductions. The resolution is the latest example of companies facing increased scrutiny from shareholders over climate change.  Shell (RDSA), for example, said last year that it would start linking executive pay to short-term carbon emissions targets in 2020 after coming under pressure from shareholders including the Church of England.  Climate Action 100+ said the BP resolution was ""good news for both investors and the planet."" Yet other activist investors may not be satisfied.  BP will face a second, tougher, climate change resolution at its annual meeting. This one is spearheaded by Follow This, a Dutch activist shareholder group that previously targeted Shell. Follow This is asking BP to set and publish climate targets related to its own operations. But it also wants the company to account for emissions generated by the oil and gas products that it sells. BP has said that while it is prioritizing making its fuels more efficient for its customers, it cannot commit to targets that go beyond its own operations. In additional to BP, Follow This has announced plans to file similar resolutions against energy companies including Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX).

246,2019-03-01,2019,3.0,1,Nerijus Adomaitis,Norway's Aker BP switching gears from M&A to exploration,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian oil and gas company Aker BP is switching emphasis from M&A toward exploration, taking a potentially riskier path to increase its resources after years when it has relied on acquisitions to add the bulk of its new barrels. The company said the change of tack was prompted by falling exploration costs, partly as a result of new technologies, as well as the rising cost of acquisitions in the energy sector because of stronger oil prices. “Back in 2015-2016, we acquired resources for 50-60-70 cents a barrel, which is really hard to drill out on the Norwegian continental shelf,” CEO Karl Johnny Hersvik told Reuters in an interview. “Now, when the drilling and the (seismic) data acquisition cost have come down, and the acquisition costs of the equivalent contingent resources have gone up, it makes sense (to explore).” Aker BP has added three times more barrels in oil and gas resources through acquisitions than it has found itself since the company was born about three years ago, Reuters calculations show. The company said it could still make acquisitions if opportunities arose, but declined to make any projections on how many barrels it could buy. Graphic: Aker BP (tmsnrt.rs/2EHoD09) Acquisitions - “inorganic growth” - contributed more than 500 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) in resources in 2016-18, according to the calculations based on the company’s annual reserve reports and investor presentations. Aker BP’s own exploration efforts during that period were far smaller: the firm added 148 million boe from discoveries - 83 million in 2016, 10 million in 2017 and 55 million last year. It cost $1.1 a barrel after tax to find new resources last year. The company, controlled by Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Roekke and 30 percent owned by BP, said in January it was hiking its exploration budget by 40 percent year-on-year to a record $500 million in 2019 and planned to drill 15 exploration wells. It aims to find around 100 million boe net in 2019-20. Its sharpened focus on exploration is, to some extent, emblematic of a wider industry trend of companies beginning to step up drilling efforts - which were curbed after the 2014 market crash - as a result of technological advances and stronger oil prices. It could however be a riskier path for Aker BP, whose rapid growth driven largely by M&A helped it weather the downturn better than many peers and has seen its share price more than triple since 2016. The company, which is solely focused on the Norwegian continental shelf, has had a mixed exploration record. It found a quarter of all new resources on the shelf in 2016, but the following year was disappointing. “We have drilled too many dry wells,” Aker BP’s exploration chief Evy Gloerstad-Clark told Reuters. “If we want to get to the top we need to get a better exploration processes in place.” But Aker BP and other firms, including Sweden’s Lundin Petroleum Norway’s largest firm Equinor, are facing a similar challenge: discoveries on the Norwegian continental shelf are getting smaller and smaller. Aker BP’s strategy during the downturn contrasted with that of its closest rival on the continental shelf, fellow mid-tier player Lundin, which stuck to a plan of organic growth via exploration. Lundin added only 21.5 million boe from discoveries in 2016-2018, its investor presentations showed. Lundin’s share price growth has lagged Aker BP’s - but the stock has still doubled since 2016, bolstered by reserve revisions at the giant Johan Sverdrup field which the firm found in 2010 and is due to start producing this year. Aker BP’s exploration push reflects a sector-wide change in investor sentiment, according to Teodor Sveen-Nilsen at Sparebank 1 Markets. “With the upturn in the cycle, investors are more focusing on exploration and reserve replacement than a few years ago, when all the focus was on return on capital and dividends.” French oil company Total is launching its biggest exploration drive for years in 2019, for example, while Chinese oil majors are also stepping up drilling. Aker BP’s CEO Hersvik said a lesson from past exploration failures was not to put all bets on one or two areas, and to do better homework to pinpoint the best spots to drill. The company said it would spend about 40 percent of its exploration budget targeting new prospects, while 60 percent will go to drill near its existing hubs. Gloerstad-Clark also said Aker BP was working to better visualize its drilling and seismic data using specialized software, but this was taking time. The Norwegian continental shelf is proving an increasingly challenging environment for explorers. In 2011-2017, discoveries averaged under 10 million boe, compared with about 110 million boe in the early years of Norway’s oil industry in 1966-1980. Aker BP started out in 2016, when Norwegian oil firm Det norske bought British major BP’s Norway business in an all-share deal, with BP taking a 30-percent stake, two years after Det norske acquired the Norwegian assets of Marathon Oil. As a result of these and subsequent deals, including the acquisition of Hess’ Norwegian assets in 2017, Aker BP’s contingent resources - proven resources that could be tapped - tripled to 946 million boe between 2016 and 2018. The company has also amassed a large acreage to explore, with stakes in 156 production licenses. Jefferies analyst Mark Wilson said Aker BP’s shift towards exploration was a logical step in the company’s development, helped by Norway’s favorable tax regime. “It’s a natural evolution that makes sense, but the proof will be in the pudding,” he added.

248,2016-05-09,2016,5.0,9,"Stephen Eisenhammer, Barbara Lewis",Brazilian lawsuit over Samarco dam will struggle to match U.S. BP claim,"RIO DE JANEIRO/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Any relief felt by the mining firms BHP Billiton and Vale over what looked like a final $5.7 billion settlement for the cost of last year’s dam burst at their Brazilian iron ore mine must have evaporated when state prosecutors scoffed at the deal and last Tuesday filed a $44 billion claim of their own. What is far from clear, however, is whether that number, based on little more than the analogy of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, which will have cost BP some $40 billion in claims and fines, will bear scrutiny. The prosecutors did not break down their claim into components, saying that “unless you want to assume that each millimeter of Brazil’s environment is worth less than that in the United States, it is unacceptable that the valuation of damage caused by the defendant companies be less, prima facie, than $43.8 billion”. A member of the prosecuting team, Jorge Munhos de Souza, said they had used the comparison of the BP case because it is “considered paradigmatic in environmental law”. But even environmental lawyers say the number probably represents little more than a speculative opening bid. “They are really just doing their job to get the full extent of the cost of remediating this issue. Otherwise, the burden is borne by the taxpayer,” said London-based ClientEarth lawyer Sophie Marjanac. When the U.S. energy group Chevron faced a 40 billion real ($11.3 billion) claim over a 2011 deep-sea oil well spill northeast of Rio de Janeiro, it finished up settling for just 300 million reais ($85 million). There are also questions about the comparability of the disasters at the Samarco mine and in the Gulf, and of the legal systems dealing with them. Certainly, the collapse of Samarco’s Fundao dam, which released 12,000 Olympic swimming pools’ worth of waste water from iron ore mining, was dramatic. The torrent not only killed 19 people but also obliterated Bento Rodrigues, a town of 800, inundated another, larger town with mud, and polluted almost 1,000 km (600 miles) of the Rio Doce. Although the river was far from pristine before the damburst, and the toxicity of the iron ore tailings is disputed, the disaster killed fish, contaminated water used for agriculture, and left at least 250,000 people without running water for weeks. Federal prosecutor Eduardo Santos de Oliveira, part of the task force that filed the 359-page lawsuit, said the figure of 155 billion reais ($44 billion) was based on a comparison with the social, environmental and humanitarian damage done by the Gulf disaster. Yet even some state prosecutors who are not involved in the claim say it is far-fetched to compare the dam burst to the release of more than 3 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico over a period of three months, after a blowout that killed 11 oil workers. That spill led to the closure of more than a third of the Gulf of Mexico for seven months to fishing for tuna, shrimp, crab and oyster, among others, damaging not only the marine environment but also tourism all along the U.S. Gulf Coast. BP is paying out on more than 300,000 individual civil claims worth over $16 billion as well as $20 billion in government civil claims, and $4 billion in criminal penalties, in addition to the $14 billion it spent on the original clean-up operation. Claimants in that case were significantly helped by U.S. pollution laws drawn up after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil tanker spill. These provide strict rules for cleaning up the damage and picking up the bill for every barrel spilt. Brazilian law does require full restoration of the environment to its prior state as well as compensation for loss of property, goods and business, but does not provide such clear guidance for calculating damages, legal sources say. And then there is the question of the settlement that Samarco and its 50-50 joint owners BHP and Vale have agreed with Brazilian authorities, which provides, among other things, for Bento Rodrigues to be rebuilt in a different location. It amounts to 20 billion reais, to be paid over 15 years. The federal prosecutors, who enjoy broad autonomy and are increasingly confident in pursuing corruption as the government is rocked by scandal, criticized the deal as inadequate and implied that the authorities had sold the Brazilian people short. But two days after they filed their suit, with the aim of challenging the settlement, a judge ratified the deal. The prosecutors vowed to appeal, creating fresh legal uncertainty. Samarco Chief Executive Roberto Carvalho told Reuters that the agreement “already carries all the socio-economic and environmental reparations which this other lawsuit proposes”. Ultimately, pragmatism may also come into play. As a foreign-owned multinational with large interests in the United States, BP had little leverage to resist its prosecution. But BHP, while listed in Britain and Australia, would have relatively little to lose if it chose to quit Brazil. It has already written down its share of Samarco from $1.2 billion to zero, and its only other significant asset in Brazil is a minority stake in the Alumar alumina smelter and refinery. Vale, meanwhile, is based in Brazil, where it has 154,000 employees and contractors - an economic mainstay that it is in Brazil’s interests not to damage too heavily. The equities and commodities analysts Bernstein said in a note that not only did the prosecutors’ arguments not bear scrutiny, but also that, “like it or not, but Brazilian prosecutors cannot exert the same kind of pressure on Vale and BHP as the Americans could on BP”.

249,2017-07-13,2017,7.0,13,Jessica Jaganathan,BP ships diesel from the U.S. to Australia in unusual move,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil major BP Plc is shipping diesel from the United States to Australia in an unusual shipping flow, several industry sources told Reuters on Thursday. The Jupiter Express carrying about 35,000 tonnes of diesel loaded from BP’s Cherry Point, Washington refinery on June 29 and is currently headed to Botany Bay, New South Wales in Australia, shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon showed. BP declined to comment. Australia imports most of its diesel requirements from Singapore, South Korea and Japan but several refineries undergoing maintenance and prompt demand from India has tightened supply of the fuel in Asia, traders said. “The decision was (likely) made due to far east premium strength, Singapore (cash premium) strength versus bringing a vessel down,” a trader with a North Asian refiner said. The cash differential for diesel with 10-parts-per-million (ppm) sulfur, a grade imported by Australia, rose to a six-month high in early July, Reuters data showed. BP last shipped diesel from the United States to Australia in December, a shipbroker said, though such cargo movements were unheard of before that. United States usually ships most of its diesel exports to Europe than Asia due to cheaper freight rates, traders said. But a rise in Singapore cash premiums for diesel has attracted the unusual reverse arbitrage flow of diesel from Europe to Asia, they added. BP has chartered the long-range Nan Lin Wan and Front Antares tankers for loading out of the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp storage and refining hub in mid-July, headed to Asia, traders and shipbrokers said. This could also be prompting the unusual flow of diesel cargo from the United States to Australia, the traders added. “I think going forward, it’s going to be more and more common to see this kind of reverse flows as Asian demand for oil products like jet fuel and diesel is growing phenomenally,” a Singapore-based trader said. But the unusual diesel imports could ease in the third quarter as refineries are expected to return from maintenance and as India’s imports of the fuel taper off due to the start of monsoon rains which typically reduce the need of the fuel in irrigation pumps.

251,2019-05-21 00:00:00,2019,5.0,21,Ivana Kottasová,BP resists shareholders' calls for radical climate change action,"London (CNN Business)BP is resisting pressure from investors and activists to take more radical action on climate change.  The company has rejected demands to follow the example set by rival Shell (RDSA) and include emissions generated by the oil it sells in its climate targets. Two shareholder groups used the annual meeting of BP (BP) investors on Tuesday to demand the company do more to tackle global warming, a day after climate activists staged a blockade of its London headquarters. Greenpeace activists, who locked themselves inside heavy containers outside the building, demanded BP stops exploration for new oil and gas altogether.  ""The company spends ... over $15 billion a year to find more oil and gas, when study after study shows that we already have more fossil fuels than we can afford to burn and still achieve the Paris targets,"" said Charlie Kronick, senior climate analyst at Greenpeace.  BP accepted a resolution drafted by Climate Action 100+, a group of 300 investors with over $33 trillion in assets under management, that calls for the company to align its business strategy with the 2015 Paris Agreement. The global accord aims to keep global warming ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius. Over 99% shareholders voted Tuesday in favor of the resolution. But executives advised investors to vote against a more radical proposition by a group called Follow This, led by Dutch shareholders who invest in oil and gas companies with the goal of changing them. It wants BP to commit to reducing all emissions, including those generated by BP's customers.  Only 8% of investors voted for the Follow This resolution. BP said it would cut 3.5 million tonnes of greenhouse gasses emissions from its operations by 2025. But it refused to set a reduction target for emissions from its products.  Follow This and other climate change activists say that without including emissions from products, setting such targets is of little use. BP, like many other energy companies, argues that it can't control indirect emissions, and it had warned investors that agreeing to the Follow This resolution would ""risk significant erosion of long-term shareholder value."" Shell is the only major energy company that has committed to cutting emissions generated by both its activities and the products it sells. It said in December it would link executive pay to these goals. But some people are still not happy with Shell's commitments. Its annual shareholder meeting in the Netherlands on Tuesday also drew protests from activists called Code Rood (Code Red), who called for the company to be dismantled.  Climate Action 100+ was among those who pressured Shell to take action, and it's scored other victories in Europe, forcing Equinor (EQNR) and Glencore (GLCNF) to take action.  The investor coalition has campaigned in the past for companies to take responsibility for reducing all greenhouse gas emissions related to their products. But it's not forcing the issue at BP, at least for now. BP said in February it would tie the bonuses of 36,000 employees to greenhouse gas reduction targets.

The charging stations will be available to Didi and non-Didi drivers. The news of Didi and BP’s joint venture comes one week after Didi announced that it had received funding totaling $600 million from Toyota Motor Corporation. As part of that deal, Didi and Toyota Motor set up a joint venture with GAC Toyota Motor to provide vehicle-related services to Didi drivers. BP’s first charging site in Guangzhou has already been connected to XAS (Xiaoju Automobile Solutions), which Didi spun out in April 2018 to put all its vehicle-related services into one platform. XAS is part of Didi Chuxing’s evolution from a ridesharing company to a mobility services platform, with its services available to other car, transportation and logistics companies. In June, Didi also opened its ridesharing platform to other companies, enabling its users to request rides from third-party providers in a bid to better compete with apps like Meituan Dianping and AutoNavi, which aggregate several ride-hailing services on their platforms. Didi says it now offers ridesharing, vehicle rental and delivery services to 550 million users and covers 1,000 cities through partnerships with Grab, Lyft, Ola, 99 and Bolt (Taxify). The company also claims to be the world’s largest electric vehicle operator with more than 600,000 EVs on its platform. It also has partnerships with automakers and other car-related companies, like Toyota, FAW, Dongfeng, GAC, Volkswagen and Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi, to collaborate on a platform that uses new energy and AI-based and mobility technologies. In a press statement, Tufan Erginbilgic, the CEO of BP’s Downstream business, said “As the world’s largest EV market, China offers extraordinary opportunities to develop innovative new businesses at scale and we see this as the perfect partnership for such a fast-evolving environment. The lessons we learn here will help us further expand BP’s advanced mobility business worldwide, helping drive the energy transition and develop solutions for a low carbon world.”",https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/31/didi-chuxing-and-oil-giant-bp-team-up-to-build-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure-in-china/,,TechCrunch
254,2017-03-29 00:00:00,2017,3.0,29,"Ron Bousso, Dmitry Zhdannikov",BP sees trading benefits from oil boom in the Americas,"LONDON (Reuters) - Oil major BP (BP.L) expects its trading operations to benefit from growing global crude trade on the back of abundant U.S., Canadian and Brazilian production and rising energy demand in Asia, a top BP executive said. Tufan Erginbilgic, the head of BP’s downstream division that includes one of the world’s most powerful trading desks, told Reuters he wanted to expand BP’s trading activities using long-term deals on third-party oil and products. U.S. shale oil production using fracking technology has turned the world’s largest oil consumer into an exporter of crude and products, while Canada is developing its vast oil sands deposits and Brazil is developing huge offshore fields. “There will be more flows in the world because where crude production will increase is the U.S., Canada, Brazil, and refining will increase in Asia and the Middle East,” Erginbilgic told Reuters in an interview. “We are not shy of optimizing the opportunities in any of our businesses,” he said when asked if BP planned to expand its trading operations as flows increased. BP, which employs about 1,800 people in oil trading, trades over 5 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil and refined products, and is only exceeded by rival Royal Dutch/Shell and trading house Vitol. The trading unit does not normally disclose results separately from the downstream business, which includes refining and petrochemical production. But industry experts estimate trading profits can be more than $1 billion in a good year. But, in an unusual move, BP said its oil trading had a loss in the fourth quarter of 2016 partly due to a $70 million lawsuit claim related to a cargo for a Moroccan refinery. It coincided with an oil price rally after OPEC announced plans to cut output. “Our supply and trading is more about physical barrels than people realize,” said Erginbilgic, referring to a common market perception that BP trades heavily on paper positions. He also said BP wanted to expand its long-term deals to trade on crude and products from third-parties. “We like our (BP) flows, but we are not limited by them,” he said. The world is becoming saturated with barrels of light crude from U.S. shale producers, while cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are reducing flows of the heavier grades that OPEC states mostly produce. This benefits Atlantic basin refineries that are less sophisticated than modern Asian and Middle Eastern plants, which can deal with heavy and more complex grades of crude, said Erginbilgic. This should boost prices of heavier fuel oil. “At some point, fuel oil will have to strengthen in this equation because people will need fuel oil to fill the cokers,” he said, referring to units that deal with heavier residual crudes in the refining process. But he said fuel oil gains were unlikely to hold for long due to new marine fuel regulations requiring the use of fuel with a lower sulfur content than fuel oil and encouraging usage of middle distillates from 2020. Middle distillates are lighter. “Distillates will strengthen in the process at least early on,” said Erginbilgic, adding that new refineries being built in Asia and the Middle East would help meet new marine fuel demand. He said global demand for distillates was poised to grow faster than gasoline. “Given the complexity of our refineries we are well positioned,” said Erginbilgic, adding that 47 percent of output from BP’s plants was distillates while less than 3 percent was high sulfur fuel oil. BP has said it does not plan to build new refineries but will modernize existing ones. Erginbilgic, who has run BP’s downstream division since 2014, said he was ensuring that the trading business worked more closely with refining to generate profits. “We brought together supply and trading and refining, they make decisions in the regions together. That allows you to optimize the pie,” he said. Writing by Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Edmund Blair",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bp-refining-trading-idUSKBN1701L2,Business News,Reuters

UPM surged 10.6 percent, the biggest gain in the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300, after reporting a 34 percent rise in adjusted operating profit in the first quarter . “European equity markets are trading moderately higher on positive corporate earnings surprises from several companies,” said Markus Huber, a trader at City of London Markets. In addition, markets see no chance the Federal Reserve will raise U.S. interest rates when it meets on Wednesday and Thursday. They see only one chance in five it will move at the next meeting, on June 14-15. That means “many traders are at least temporarily moving their overall exposure to more neutral from previous negative, consequently closing some of their short positions,” Huber said. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index, which closed 0.6 percent lower on Monday after hitting a three-month high in the previous week, was 0.3 percent higher by 1015 GMT. The European oil and gas index rose 0.8 percent after oil advanced on a weaker dollar and a flood of new cash into the market, although some analysts warned of more output from Saudi Arabia and Iran. Shares in BP rose 4.2 percent. The company’s profit dropped 80 percent in the first quarter, but it beat analysts’ expectations. BP also held its dividend and said it could cut capital spending further. “It appears the result was positively impacted by better availability, lower costs and importantly a better trading result,” RBC analysts said in a note. Banks rose 2 percent, making them the top sectoral gainer. Standard Chartered surged 9.8 percent after it posted stronger-than-expected first quarter results and said restructuring costs were in line with its plans.

257,2016-01-12,2016,1.0,12,Dmitry Zhdannikov,BP to slash thousands more jobs in face of oil downturn,"LONDON (Reuters) - British oil and gas company BP announced plans on Tuesday to slash 5 percent of its global workforce in the face of a continued slump in oil prices. It said it aims to reduce its global oil production, or upstream, headcount by 4,000 to 20,000 as it undergoes a $3.5 billion restructuring program. BP said its headcount totaled around 80,000 at the end of 2015. With crude oil prices at 12-year lows of around $32 a barrel, the world’s biggest oil and gas producers are set to continue aggressively slashing spending this year as they face their longest period of investment cuts in decades. “We want to simplify (our) structure and reduce costs without compromising safety. Globally, we expect the headcount in upstream to be below 20,000 by the end of the year,” a company spokesman said. In the North Sea, he said BP planned to reduce headcount by 600 people over the next two years with most cuts likely in 2016. BP shares, which have fallen by around 40 percent since the oil price began to slide in mid-2014, were up 1.2 percent at 1157 GMT compared with a 0.8 percent rise for the broader sector index. Oil companies including Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron have already slashed tens of thousands jobs globally to deal with a near 75 percent drop in oil prices since June 2014 that has seen earnings collapse. BP, which must also pay $20 billion in fines to resolve the deadly 2010 Gulf of Mexico spill, announced in October plans for a third round of spending cuts and said it would limit capital spending, or capex, to $17-19 billion a year through to 2017. The company, which has already sold over $50 billion of assets in recent years in order to cover the spill costs, said it expected an additional $3-5 billion of divestments in 2016. Fourth-quarter upstream earnings for oil majors are expected to fall by 84 percent from a year earlier and 48 percent from the previous quarter, according to analysts at Macquarie.

261,2016-04-11,2016,4.0,11,,BP bonus backlash intensifies as investor adviser urges rejection,"LONDON, April 11 (Reuters) - BP faces further opposition to its pay at its annual meeting on Thursday after British shareholder advisory group ShareSoc recommended its members vote against the oil major’s remuneration report. Chief Executive Bob Dudley is in line for a $19.6 million compensation package for 2015, a year in which shrinking profit margins triggered by sharp falls in the price of oil led to more than 5,000 job losses at the oil and gas company. nL8N15H0ZC “We consider the pay of the CEO to be simply too high, and particularly so in a year when the company suffered a record loss of $6.4 billion in 2015. Even so his pay went up by 20 percent,” the group said in a statement on Monday. ShareSoc said the high executive pay was partly due to BP’s “excessively complex” remuneration scheme which includes six performance measures to calculate bonuses. The group is the latest voice to join a chorus of shareholders and advisors objecting to BP’s pay plans. Last week, Royal London Asset Management branded the proposed increase in Dudley’s pay as “unreasonable and insensitive” and said it would against the report. Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have also recommended that BP shareholders reject the remuneration packages, which they say are over-generous, in light of the company’s biggest-ever annual loss. BP has defended its stance on boardroom pay, despite the rising ire among investors, who have seen the value of their shares drop by 24 percent in the last year. “BP’s performance surpassed the board’s expectations on almost all of the measures that determine remuneration - and the outcome reflects this,” a BP spokesman told Reuters on April 8.

262,2018-02-20,2018,2.0,20,Ron Bousso,BP sees self-driving electric vehicles crimping oil demand by 2040,"LONDON (Reuters) - The emergence of self-driving electric cars and travel sharing are set to dent oil consumption by 2040, oil and gas giant BP (BP.L) said, forecasting a peak in demand for the first time. In its benchmark annual Energy Outlook, BP forecast a 100-fold growth in electric vehicles by 2040, with its chief economist Spencer Dale painting a world in which we travel much more but instead of using private cars, we increasingly share trips in autonomous vehicles. While travel demand more than doubles over the period as economies in countries such as China and India grow, higher oil demand will be more than offset by increased engine efficiency standards as well as the larger number of EVs and shared traveling. Unlike many other forecasts, including previous BP Energy Outlooks, which looked solely at the growing share of EVs in the car fleet, BP this year focused on the share of vehicles kilometers powered by electricity. Under BP’s Evolving Transition scenario, which assumes that policies and technology continue to evolve at a speed similar to that seen in the recent past, some 30 percent of car kilometers are powered by electricity by 2040 from almost zero in 2016. At the same time, the number of EVs is set to increase from 3 million today to over 320 million by 2040, representing roughly 15 percent out of a total car fleet of 2 billion. The gap between the increasing number of EVs on the road and the kilometers powered by electricity is due to the expected growth in so-called shared mobility by EVs, Dale said. “Cars will be used much more intensely over time,” Dale told reporters in a briefing on Monday ahead of the release of the report on Tuesday. As a result, fuel demand from the car fleet is forecast to dip to 18.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2040 from 18.7 million bpd in 2016, when it represented around one fifth of total oil demand, according to BP. BP expects autonomous vehicles to become available in the early 2020s. Their initial high cost means the vast majority of the cars will be bought by fleets offering shared mobility services. The average electric car is expected to be driven about two and a half times more than an internal combustion car, according to Dale. “What we expect to see in the 2030s is a huge growth in shared mobility autonomous cars ... Once you don’t have to pay for a driver, the cost of taking one of those share mobility fleets services will fall by about 40 or 50 percent,” Dale said. The vast majority of the shared mobility is expected to be EVs because of their lower maintenance costs. Car makers including General Motors (GM.N) and high-tech giants such as Google Waymo and Uber Technologies have poured billions into the autonomous vehicles industry hoping gain a first-mover advantage. Robo-taxi services are seen as the main use for most self-driving vehicles. BP sharply raised its estimate of growth in electric vehicles in the coming decades from last year’s forecast that EVs would reach 100 million by 2035. The big upwards revision is due to an increase in hybrid cars and an expected sharp growth in EV purchases in the second half of the 2030s, Dale said. London-based BP joined other oil companies such as Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) in forecasting a peak for oil demand in the late 2030s, when it is expected to slightly decline at around 110 million bpd. It did not foresee a peak in demand in its previous outlooks that stretched into 2035. While the transportation sector will continue to dominate the growth in oil consumption, demand for plastic manufacturing will become the main source of growth in the 2030s. Oil companies such as BP, Shell and France’s Total (TOTF.PA) are betting on growing demand from the petrochemical sector in the coming decades. Dale however said changes in regulations for plastics consumption such as stringent policies on plastic bags and packaging could dent oil demand by as much as 2 million bpd, roughly the same as the impact of EVs. Overall energy demand will continue to grow in the coming decades, rising by a third into 2040, or roughly 1.3 percent per year, driven by growth in China and India, but the world is learning to “do more with less energy” as economies become more efficient, Dale said. For example, the European Union’s gross domestic product is set to treble in 2040 from 1975 but the level of energy demand will be the same. China’s energy demand will continue to grow but at a slower pace by the 2030s, when India will become the main driver of growth. BP once again revised upwards its forecast for growth in renewable power, which is set to grow by 40 percent by 2040, with its share in the energy mix increasing from 4 percent to 14 percent. The revision is due to technological gains as well as more aggressive government policies, particularly in India and China. “There is plenty of scope for policy to continue to surprise us” to further boost the growth in the renewables, Dale said.

Under BP’s tolling agreement with Limetree Bay Refining LLC, owner of the idled Hovensa refinery, BP will supply the facility with crude and sell its products, low-sulfur fuels that will meet an International Maritime Organization mandate in 2020, it said in a statement. BP declined to comment further. Limetree did not respond to requests for comment. Limetree, owned by private equity firm ArcLight Capital Partners LLC, is investing $1.5 billion to bring the Hovensa refinery, one of the largest such facilities in the world, back online by late 2019, with plans to process 200,000 barrels per day (bpd). It aims to produce low-sulfur fuels that satisfy the International Maritime Organization rule calling for large vessels to switch by 2020 to fuels containing no more than 0.5 percent sulfur from 3.5 percent. The rule is widely expected to spur new demand for the distillates the refinery would produce. Limetree’s facility has more than 1,100 construction workers on site and has brought online 25 million barrels of crude storage capacity.

264,2017-06-15,2017,6.0,15,Liz Hampton,BP Energy Partners selling midstream portfolio company: sources,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - BP Energy Partners, an energy investment company backed by oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens, is selling portfolio company Pinnacle Midstream, according to four sources familiar with the matter. Houston-based Pinnacle, which operates natural gas and crude gathering, processing and transloading services, could sell for at least $300 million, one of the sources said. The move comes as deal-making has heated up for companies that provide pipeline, processing and storage facilities in U.S. shale basins. In April, funds managed by private equity firm Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) agreed to acquire EagleClaw Midstream Ventures for about $2 billion. Earlier, Targa Resources Corp (TRGP.N) snapped up Outrigger Energy LLC’s Permian Basin gathering and processing assets for $1.5 billion. Private equity investors have targeted midstream businesses, which are often viewed as less exposed to commodity price risk, because pipeline and storage assets tend to have recurring fee-for-service revenue streams. Greg Sargent, chief executive of Pinnacle, declined to comment on the sale. A spokesman for BP Energy also declined to comment. Pinnacle’s operations are focused in Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Mississippi. The company this week said it had started engineering and construction on a 60 million cubic foot per day cryogenic gas processing plant near Orla, Texas in the prolific Permian Basin, where lower production costs and amply oil reserves have companies aggressively drilling new wells. In March, Pinnacle opened a truck transloading facility, also near Orla, Texas, and said it was flowing crude and gas through its gathering systems. Sources interviewed by Reuters said potential buyers would likely see value in a deal with Pinnacle due to longer-term contracts underpinning its assets. Pickens’ BP Energy Partners manages funds that focus on investing in companies involved in North American natural gas businesses.

265,2017-10-18,2017,10.0,18,Ron Bousso,BP eyes smaller renewable investments to avoid repeating losses,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP is targeting smaller and wider-ranging investments in renewable energy to avoid large losses in the sector like those it suffered earlier in the decade, Chief Executive Bob Dudley said on Wednesday. BP and peers including Royal Dutch Shell and Total have recognized the need to reduce carbon emissions in the fight against global warming, but their investment in renewables remains tiny compared to oil and gas. “We’re making smarter, in many cases, smaller bets, and making more of them across a wider range of technologies and business models,” Dudley said in a speech at the Oil & Money conference. “Rather than bolting on a whole series of low-carbon businesses, as we have in the past, we’re building low carbon into what we do.” BP made a number of large investments in solar power, wind farms in the United States, carbon-capturing technology and biofuels in the 2000s under the leadership of John Browne, who sought to rebrand the company as “Beyond Petroleum”. Some of those investments failed to pan out and BP in 2011 wrote off its solar business. BP still operates in renewables, including a large onshore wind power business in the United States, but those businesses are not generating much profit, he said. “We’re thinking beyond petroleum,” Dudley said. “Our shareholders want to know we are committed and studying this ... We just don’t know the answers yet.” Within its traditional oil and gas business, BP is also developing low-carbon fuels for ground and air transportation and even ways of reducing carbon in cement, Dudley said. The London-listed company is considering getting back into solar power, but unlike the previous attempt when it focused on producing panels, this time it wants to integrate solar with gas power generation in specific countries, Dudley said. “Through these venturing and partnership activities, we are building our understanding so that we can avoid large speculative investments and instead give ourselves as much optionality as possible to back winners as they emerge.” Dudley reiterated his call for a global price on carbon emissions, which would make cleaner energies, including renewables and gas, more profitable to develop. “This time the global commitment to action feels different, and the national pledges are a good start. But frankly we need even stronger and clearer signals to create the confidence to invest in and grow low-carbon businesses at scale.” Reporting by Ron Bousso; Editing by Dale Hudson",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bp-renewables/bp-eyes-smaller-renewable-investments-to-avoid-repeating-losses-idUSKBN1CN1HA,Environment,Reuters

267,2018-09-14,2018,9.0,14,"Dmitry Zhdannikov, Julia Payne, Amanda Cooper","BP, Vitol go head to head in West African crude trading","LONDON (Reuters) - Oil major BP has clashed with rival Vitol in the once-languid West African crude market, buying up cargoes and taking a big derivative position that may have raised costs for European refiners. The West African crude market typically sees cargoes of Nigerian and Angolan change hands in back-to-back deals outside the Platts window, a system widely used by the industry to price crude. Pricing agency S&P Global Platts sets key oil benchmarks for the market. New trading opportunities arose from August, when broker Sunrise started the first derivative for Nigeria’s four largest crude oil grades - Bonny Light, Forcados, Qua Iboe and Bonga - mirroring derivatives trading in the North Sea. The derivatives, known as contracts for differences (CFDs), allow traders to bet on whether premiums of the four Nigerian grades versus the Brent benchmark will rise or fall. The CFDs, also known as swaps, can be used to hedge against price fluctuations during the voyage of a physical cargo to a consumer, which can take weeks. But CFDs can also be used to take a speculative position. According to five traders familiar with the developments, who asked not to be named because they are not allowed to speak to the media, BP quietly built a long position of up to 10 million barrels in the African CFDs contracts in August, betting the premium of the grades to Brent will rise in September. Against BP in the paper market were six trading desks, including trading giant Vitol, which took the opposite side of the bet and went short CFDs, betting that African grades’ premiums to Brent would fall, according to trading sources. The paper deals were done on a back-to-back basis with only BP, Vitol and five other companies aware of the developments. BP said it does not comment on trading positions. “However, BP welcomes the introduction of the new West African swap to provide greater transparency and aid price discovery in the West African crude market,” it said on Friday. The trades took place in what has long been a regulatory gray area. London’s Financial Conduct Authority, which does not regulate London trading in the West African crude market, but does oversee the UK Brent crude benchmark, declined to comment. BP does not produce oil in Nigeria and has not been a large trader of Nigerian oil in recent years, although it has bought some cargoes for its refining system. After quietly building its paper position in August, BP launched a flurry of bids on the Platts system in September for physical cargoes of Nigerian oil. BP bid for a total of 22 Nigerian cargoes loading between Sept 3-12, a previously unseen volume in the West African crude market, where a whole month can sometimes go without a single public bid or offer in the Platts window. BP’s bidding activity ushered premiums of the African grades against the Brent benchmark to as high as $1.70 per barrel compared to a premium of $1.20 a barrel in August, when BP was building its CFDs position. A difference of 50 cents per barrel would in theory bring a profit of $5 million on a 10-million-barrel CFD position. The rise in premiums in the physical market made BP a big winner on its long position on the CFDs trade, while Vitol was a loser, according to traders. In reaction, Vitol spent over $500 million to buy seven cargoes outside the Platts system from oil majors Total and Shell, paying premiums above $1.70 per barrel, according to three traders familiar with the developments. The trading house then re-sold the cargoes on the Platts system to BP at premiums ranging between $1.55-$1.75 per barrel, effectively accepting a loss on the physical trade but limiting its losses on the CFD side. “Tensions were running huge between BP and Vitol. It was a high stakes game,” said a trader familiar with the development. Vitol declined to comment on the story. S&P Global Platts said it always ensures bids and offers are firm, performable and tradeable and that its price assessments are reflective of market value. “We have seen a marked increase in the past several weeks of transparent information in the West African crude market,” said Jonty Rushforth, senior director at S&P Global Platts. “Alongside the increase in physical information we have seen a growing derivatives market,” he added. “As the importance of that market globally has grown, we have seen the broader market embrace risk management tools related to it.” Market participants said the main losers from the developments in the West African market will be refiners. Nigerian state oil firm NNPC sets its monthly official selling prices (OSP) to long-term crude buyers, mainly refiners, retroactively and based on prices in the Platts system. “This is very bad from a refiners’ perspective. Every seller is now asking high prices and when they show a cargo, all they say is: “If you don’t buy, we’ll just sell to BP,” said a source with a European refiner.

269,2016-01-21,2016,1.0,21,"Oleg Vukmanovic, Sarah McFarlane","Stuck at sea, BP's LNG shipment highlights Egypt's payment struggle","MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - BP’s diversion of a tanker of liquefied natural gas (LNG) away from Egypt due to payment issues is the first sign that the country’s currency crisis could be jeopardizing its energy supplies, traders said. Earlier this month the tanker British Sapphire was diverted to Brazil rather than discharging in Egypt, with the delivery of the LNG cargo for Egypt delayed up until October, traders said. BP declined to comment. Egypt’s state-owned EGAS was not available to comment. Egypt has been struggling to pay for U.S. dollar-priced oil products and LNG due to an acute foreign currency crisis, worsened by the Russian airliner disaster in October, which hit tourism revenue. Last year Egypt became a major market for LNG shippers such as BP and Europe’s elite commodity merchants after the startup of two import terminals, but a payment freeze for deliveries until March has resulted in a $400-$500 million bill so far, trade sources say. It is an unwelcome addition to Egypt’s already growing arrears to foreign oil companies involved in producing oil and gas in the country, up at $3 billion at the end of December. In BP’s case this has begun to translate into deliveries being pushed back nine months into the future in the latest case, a source said, raising the prospect of patchy supplies to Egypt’s energy-intensive industries and power plants. BP’s British Sapphire arrived outside the country’s Ain Sokhna import terminal on Dec. 24 and proceeded to spend the next fortnight circling offshore before on Jan. 7 the vessel’s destination changed. It is currently en route to Brazil, shipping data shows. “The British Sapphire was redirected because (BP’s) previous cargo was not paid for,” a trader said. Egypt’s LNG suppliers include Shell, Gas Natural, Trafigura, Vitol, EDF Trading, PetroChina and Noble. Gas shipments should continue uninterrupted from trade houses after Egypt promised to repay LNG debts by dipping into multi-billion dollar cash infusions by the World Bank, China and other institutions expected in coming months, the sources said. But uncertainty remains over what proportion of Chinese, World Bank and other aid will go toward the petroleum sector. Forthcoming Saudi oil aid should also free Egypt’s hand to dedicate its replenished U.S. dollar reserves to repaying gas debts since purchases of oil on the open market will be minimized, one LNG trader said. In a bid to ride out its cash crunch, last month Egypt proposed to extend payment terms for LNG to 90 days after the date of unloading, from 15 days previously.

270,2017-03-01,2017,3.0,1,,BP buys Clean Energy's U.S. green gas production assets for $155 million,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP (BP.L) agreed on Wednesday to buy Clean Energy Fuels Corp’s (CLNE.O) biomethane production assets for $155 million, expanding its huge gas supply portfolio in the United States and showing its shift to less carbon-intensive projects. BP will take over Clean Energy’s existing and two new biomethane production sites as well as supply contracts from third parties, the companies said. As part of the deal, the U.S. company has also signed a long-term contract to purchase biomethane from BP. Clean Energy captures biomethane gas emitted from landfill waste sites and then processes and purifies it to pump through pipelines. It is mainly used as a fuel for transport. The U.S. company retains its green gas downstream business and will continue supplying biomethane gas at its almost 600 fuelling stations. Shares in Clean Energy were up as much as 17 percent at 1620 GMT, while BP shares were up 2.4 percent, outperforming the European sector index .SXEP that traded 1.8 percent higher. “Demand for renewable natural gas is growing quickly and BP is pleased to expand our supply capability in this area,” Alan Haywood, chief executive officer of BP’s supply and trading business, said. Clean Energy said it would continue to collect environmental credits on gas purchased from BP and sold to end-consumers. Clean Energy sold 60 million gasoline gallon equivalents of the biomethane fuel last year to customers including logistics firm UPS and the City of Santa Monica’s transit agency, it said. BP said in a strategy update on Tuesday that it was exploring new investments in low-carbon forms of energy, a part of the industry in which it sees significant future business potential.

271,2019-04-11,2019,4.0,11,"Meng Meng, Chen Aizhu",BP latest oil major to exit China's shale gas after poor drilling results,"SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - European oil major BP plans to exit from two production sharing contracts (PSC) for projects drilling for shale gas in the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan, three sources with the knowledge of the matter said this week. BP is the last of the international oil majors, including Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and ENI, to quit exploring for shale gas in China because of poor drilling results. Its departure leaves the sector firmly in the hands of domestic companies. In March 2016, BP agreed with China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) to explore and produce natural gas from shale rock formations in the Neijiang-Dazu block in Sichuan, its first such contract in China. It inked a second PSC on the Rongchangbei block later in 2016. CNPC was the operator in both deals. BP no longer wants to proceed with the Sichuan projects after drilling eight to 10 wells with disappointing results, two of the three sources said. One of the wells, the Wei 206-H1 that was drilled to a depth of 4,368 meters (14,300 feet) in the Neijiang-Dazu block, produced about 10,000 cubic meters a day of gas during test production, a fraction of the output from a typical CNPC shale gas well in the same geological zone, IHS Markit said in a research note. China is only just beginning to develop its vast shale gas resources with production last year making up only 6 percent of total natural gas output, because of geology that makes gas extraction difficult and a challenging operating environment. With BP and the other oil majors gone, PetroChina Co, CNPC’s listed arm, and Sinopec Corp are likely to dominate China’s shale gas sector using low-cost technology and services developed domestically. BP’s Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said last week at a conference in Shanghai that the Sichuan projects faced “great challenges” because of its complex geology. To overcome those problems, BP used technology from its shale developments in the United States at the Sichuan site, Chinese business news portal The Paper reported. BP did not immediately respond to request for comment. PetroChina declined to comment. Zhu Kunfeng, a Beijing-based associate director of upstream research with IHS Markit, said poor economics are the key reason holding BP back from pursuing further in Sichuan. “As the last trial for IOCs on China’s shale gas, BP’s decision will impact foreign firms’ confidence in China’s shale gas sector,” Zhu said.

272,2018-10-30,2018,10.0,30,"Ron Bousso, Shadia Nasralla",BP's profits thunder to five-year high,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP’s profits thundered to a five-year high, boosted by stronger oil prices with production set to rise further thanks to the $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP Billiton’s U.S. shale business this week. Graphic: BP Third-Quarter Profits - tmsnrt.rs/2P25Zqn The results further underscore a striking shift in BP over the past year as it shakes off the legacy of the deadly 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster with new projects and the BHP deal, its largest acquisition in 20 years. In a further sign of confidence, BP said it now expected to fully fund the acquisition from available cash without resorting to a rights issue as planned. It still plans to sell $5-$6 billion of assets to reduce debt. “We’re a bit cautious to use the words ‘blow out’ when talking about BP, but today’s results are just that,” Bernstein analyst Oswald Clint said in a note. BP shares were up 3.4 percent by 0914 GMT, compared with a 1 percent rise in the broader European oil and gas sector. The rise in oil prices over the past year to their highest since late 2014 has boosted revenue for oil companies such as BP. Coupled with deep cost cuts and stricter spending since the 2014 downturn, the sector has enjoyed rapid growth in profits. BP’s third-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, the company’s definition of net income, rose to $3.8 billion, far exceeding forecasts of $2.85 billion based on a company-provided survey of analysts. That compared with a profit of $1.86 billion a year earlier and $2.8 billion in the second quarter of 2018. The profit increase came as production in the first nine months of the year rose thanks to new fields and high oil and gas field reliability. Underlying pretax profit for BP’s upstream business more than doubled to around $4 billion in the quarter compared with a year ago. “We’re seeing a backdrop of a strong and well-performing business,” Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary told Reuters. “We’re confident within the financial frame we can close this transaction with all cash,” Gilvary said. Oil and gas production for the first nine months of the year increased to 2.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) and was set to rise further with the expected completion of the BHP deal on Oct. 31. BP launched nine major oil and gas fields over the past year, including in Azerbaijan, Oman, Egypt and Angola that will help boost production by 900,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) by 2021. Most of the production will be gas. The BHP deal is set to initially add over 100,000 boed in production before disposals, which will mostly include predominantly onshore U.S. shale gas producing assets that BP already owns, Gilvary said. Gearing, the ratio between debt and BP’s market value, declined to 27.5 percent at the end of the quarter from 27.8 percent at the end of June. Net debt was $39.2 billion at the end of September. Gilvary said that gearing could temporarily rise next year above the 30 percent limit the company had set, depending on oil prices, as it pays for the BHP deal. In the fourth quarter, BP expects lower refining margins and more refinery turnarounds mainly at its Whiting site in the United States. BP expects its capex in 2018 to be around $15 billion.

The fire was under control, the police department said. The plant that processes 1.5 billion cubic feet per day in natural gas gathered from offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. A BP spokesman was not immediately available to discuss operations at the Pascagoula plant, which a company website described as among the 10 largest such facilities in the United States. The Pascagoula plant handles half of BP’s natural gas production from the Gulf. Several social media messages from Pascagoula residents said the blaze had erupted at Chevron Corp’s 330,000 bpd refinery in Pascagoula. The police department said the fire was not at the Chevron refinery.

The venture will operate Copersucar’s recently built ethanol storage complex in the Brazilian city of Paulínia, the country’s largest fuels hub. The announcement comes two days after Brazil’s lower house of Congress passed legislation proposing to increase the use of biofuels in the country while fuel sales start to recover from a two-year recession. Copersucar’s Paulínia ethanol complex has capacity to move 2.3 billion liters of the fuel per year and is able to store 180 million liters at its ten tanks, the companies said in a statement. “This partnership will allow BP to sharply increase its commercial presence in Brazil,” Mario Lindenhayn, country head for BP, said in the statement.

Greenpeace activists arrived at the building in St James’ Square in central London at 0200 GMT and encased themselves in specially designed containers to block all of the main entrances. A team of activists abseiled from the top of the building and placed huge letters over the windows reading ‘CLIMATE EMERGENCY’. “BP is fuelling a climate emergency that threatens millions of lives and the future of the living world,” said Paul Morozzo, a Greenpeace activist. “The science is clear - we must stop searching for new oil and gas if we want a liveable planet. BP must clean up or clear out,” Morozzo said. BP said that impeding safe entry and exit from the building was dangerous and “clearly a matter for the police to resolve as swiftly as possible.” “We welcome discussion, debate, even peaceful protest on the important matter of how we must all work together to address the climate challenge,” the BP statement added. London’s Met Police later said four people had been arrested for aggravated tresspass and that police remained on the scene. BP is due to hold its annual general meeting (AGM) of shareholders on Tuesday in the Scottish oil city of Aberdeen. Greenpeace said it would keep the London HQ closed for at least a week. “At their AGM tomorrow BP’s [CEO] Bob Dudley has a choice - he can immediately end oil exploration and start switching to 100% renewables or wind down the company,” Morozzo said. BP this year backed a resolution being put to investors on Tuesday for it to be more transparent about its emissions, link executive pay to reducing emissions from BP’s operations and show how future investments meet the 2015 Paris climate agreement to limit global warming. But as BP’s 2018 carbon emissions rose to their highest in six years, the London-based major is being lobbied by activists and an increasing number of shareholders to ensure its operations are in line with goals set by the 2015 Paris climate deal to curb global warming. Environmental activists led by British climate group Extinction Rebellion last month scaled scaffolding at the London headquarter of rival Royal Dutch Shell, painting slogans in red while activists glued themselves to the building doors. Shell has agreed to the industry’s most ambitious targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. BP, which employs 73,000 people, produces 3.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day - more than OPEC members such as United Arab Emirates or Kuwait. BP has said it aims to keep emissions from its operations flat in the decade until 2025, despite strong growth in its business which has been rebuilding after facing $67 billion in fines and clean-up costs following the disastrous 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.

277,2016-02-26,2016,2.0,26,,Former BP rig supervisor found not guilty in oil spill case,"(Reuters) - A former BP Plc supervisor was found not guilty by a New Orleans jury on Thursday of a single pollution charge stemming from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon drilling disaster that killed 11 people. Robert Kaluza was the last of four people who had faced charges in connection with the disaster, the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history. Kaluza, along with another former well-site manager, was accused of ignoring warning signs and botching safety testing that resulted in the rupture and explosion of BP’s Macondo well, sending millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. A jury on Thursday found Kaluza not guilty of a single misdemeanor count of violating the U.S. Clean Water Act. If convicted, he could have faced up to a year in jail. A spokesman for the U.S. Justice Department declined to comment on the jury’s decision. Kaluza and Donald Vidrine, the two highest-ranking supervisors on board the Deepwater Horizon rig, had initially faced charges of manslaughter and violating the Clean Water Act. The federal government dismissed involuntary manslaughter charges against the men, saying a review after the incident determined the case did not meet the criteria for gross negligence. In March 2015, a federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling to drop charges of seamen’s manslaughter against Kaluza and Vidrine, saying that the men’s responsibilities on the rig did not constitute the “marine operations, maintenance and navigation” of a ship. Vidrine in December pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor violation of the Clean Water Act and was sentenced to probation, the Justice Department said. None of the four charged in the disaster have been sentenced to jail time. BP has sustained more than $42 billion in charges from the disaster aboard the rig. The company is awaiting a separate ruling from a New Orleans federal judge, expected some time this year, over its fines under the U.S. Clean Water Act.

278,2016-02-02,2016,2.0,2,"Karolin Schaps, Ron Bousso",BP reports biggest ever annual loss,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP (BP.L) slumped to its biggest annual loss last year and announced thousands more job cuts on Tuesday, showing that even one of the nimblest oil producers is struggling in the worst market downturn in over a decade. The British oil and gas company, which is still grappling with about $55 billion of costs from the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, said it would cut 7,000 jobs by the end of 2017, or nearly 9 percent of its workforce. BP said it lost $6.5 billion in 2015 and its fourth-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, which is the company’s definition of net income, came in at $196 million, well below analyst expectations of $730 million. BP shares fell as much as 8.5 percent and were 8.1 percent lower at 6.36 a.m ET, the worst performer on the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 and on track for their biggest one-day fall since June 2010. The company’s 2015 loss shows that even its “shrink to grow” strategy adopted after the Macondo rig explosion in 2010, hailed as the best preparation for a weak oil market, was unable to buffer the impact of the lowest oil prices since 2003. “Should low oil prices prevail, they’re a quarter or two away from having to cut the dividend, or divest some more assets,” said Jack Allardyce, analyst at Cenkos Securities. Dividends are considered sacrosanct among most major oil companies but BP’s weak results and outlook are likely to put pressure on a company that has had to increase borrowing. BP maintained its 2015 dividend at 10 cents per share. BP’s results are the latest to show the extent large oil companies are struggling following a 70 percent slide in oil prices since the middle of 2014 that has forced them to cut tens of thousands of jobs and slash spending. BP’s 2015 annual loss was bigger than the overall loss of $4.9 billion it reported in 2010, even though it took a $17.2 billion hit in the second quarter of that year after the explosion in the Gulf of Mexico. BP declined to comment when asked if the company’s 2015 loss was the biggest on record. Chevron (CVX.N), the second biggest U.S. producer behind Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), reported its first quarterly loss last week in more than 13 years. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) is expected to report a near halving of profits. BP’s poor results came a day after credit ratings agency Standard and Poor’s placed the company on the path toward a credit downgrade and lowered Shell’s rating. BP took a bigger-than-expected hit at its upstream oil and gas production business and booked charges of $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter because of low oil prices, including on fields in the Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. Utica shale acreage in Ohio and Libya. Analysts at Bernstein said warmer than expected weather in 2015 probably meant that BP took a hit from some of its oil and gas hedging positions. Benchmark Brent oil prices averaged $43 a barrel in the fourth quarter of 2015, down from $76 a year earlier. The poor market backdrop is set to persist with Brent averaging about $33 per barrel in 2016 so far. BP said if the current downturn persists for longer than anticipated, it would be able to reduce its costs further to allow its balance sheet to break even below $60 a barrel. “Should current conditions persist for longer than anticipated, we expect that all the actions we are taking will capture more deflation,” Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary said in a statement. The oil and gas sector is set to slash spending to its lowest in six years in 2016 to $522 billion, following a 22 percent fall to $595 billion in 2015, according to analysts. It would be the first time since 1986 that the industry has cut spending for two consecutive years. BP said its capital spending came to $18.7 billion in 2015, down from a planned $24-$26 billion, and it expected 2016 spending to be at the lower end of a $17-19 billion range. BP reduced operating costs by $3.5 billion last year and said it expected savings to reach $7 billion by 2017. It plans to cut 3,000 jobs in its downstream division by the end of 2017, on top of 4,000 cuts in its oil and gas production business announced last year. “We are continuing to move rapidly to adapt and rebalance BP for the changing environment,” Chief Executive Bob Dudley said in a statement. Despite lower revenue from oil production, BP’s output rose 5.4 percent to 2.26 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Its refining and trading operations, benefiting from cheap fuel prices, once again offset losses in oil and gas production, although BP indicated that supply and trading weakened over the fourth quarter compared to a year earlier. Like many of its peers, BP has tapped the debt market to plug the gap in income to cover spending and dividend payouts. BP said it intends to maintain its debt at current levels. Its debt-to-equity ratio stood at 21.6 percent at the end of 2015. Editing by Jason Neely and David Clarke",http://www.reuters.com/article/bp-results-idUSL8N15H0ZC,Business News,Reuters

Gunvor began building its U.S trading operations last year, expanding outside its core markets in Europe, Asia and Africa. The company initially focusing on refined products and natural gas but this year has hired several traders to launch a crude oil desk in Houston, Texas, and beefed up its Canadian trading desk. Garza will start in September as the new managing director for Gunvor USA, based in Houston, a Gunvor spokesman said. He will replace Francois Ostinelli, who will retire after helping set up Gunvor’s U.S. operations and hiring more than 30 employees in offices in Houston and Stamford. Garza was at BP for 24 years, including managing BP’s crude oil trading in the United States, Canada and Latin America between 2006-2014. That included all of BP’s exposure to the global WTI book - at the time BP’s largest crude book, according to Garza’s LinkedIn page. Garza says on his page his team was marketing at the time 500,000 barrels of equity crude oil per day and generating record trading with 25 percent growth per year. After leaving BP in 2014, Garza served as vice president for crude oil supply and trading at Texan-based refiner Tesoro, now called Andeavor Corporation.

The sale, which is expected to complete in the coming weeks, would mark the end of BP’s 50-year-old partnership in the Gulf of Suez Petroleum Company (GUPCO) as the London-based company focuses on developing Egypt’s large offshore gas reserves. Dragon Oil, a subsidiary of Dubai’s Emirates National Oil Company (ENOC), has said it plans to expand its international operations and boost its production to 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2025. GUPCO produces over 70,000 barrels per day of oil and 400 million cubic feet per day of gas, the sources said. A BP spokesman declined to comment. The Egyptian Petroleum Ministry and the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) had no immediate comment. ENOC could not be reached for comment. The GUPCO sale has received the initial approval of Egypt’s Petroleum Ministry after it had objected to an agreement BP had reached last year with North African-focused oil and gas company SDX Energy to buy the asset, one of the sources said. Dragon Oil’s main asset is Turkmenistan’s Cheleken field, where it produces close to 90,000 bpd. In Egypt, it has a 100% interest in the East Zeit Bay block. The cash raised from the sale will help BP towards its goal of selling more than $5 billion of assets following the $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP’s onshore oil and gas assets in the United States last year. BP’s total net production in Egypt reached 49,000 bpd of oil and gas liquids and 878 million cubic feet per day of gas in 2018, according to its annual report. In February, BP launched the Giza/Fayoum field in the West Nile Delta offshore area which is expected to produce around 60,000 boe/d.

The deal will leave Aker BP with holdings of 90 percent in each field, and will help pay for projects such as the Valhall Flank West, which is estimated to come on stream in 2020. Aker BP in October announced a $2 billion deal to buy Hess Corp’s (HES.N) 64.05 percent stake in the Valhall field and 62.5 percent in Hod, raising its ownership to 100 percent, but added it would seek a partner for the license. “After we announced the Hess transaction, we have seen strong interest to partner with Aker BP in the Valhall area. Through this transaction, we get a partner that shares our ambition of developing the upside potential in these fields,” Aker BP Chief Executive Karl Johnny Hersvik said in a statement. Pandion in June won permission from Norway’s energy ministry to hold oil and gas licenses, and is backed by private equity fund manager Kerogen Capital. Aker BP’s top owners are Norwegian investment firm Aker ASA (AKER.OL) with a 40 percent stake and BP Plc (BP.L) with 30 percent.

After a slow start to the year, global oil demand recovered in the second quarter of 2017 and was expected to grow by 1.4 to 1.5 million barrels per day, Brian Gilvary told Reuters. “Global demand is looking pretty strong, and prices will firm around the levels seen today,” he said. Brent crude oil prices averaged $51.71 a barrel in the first half of 2017 and are currently just below $53 a barrel. Global demand was at around 95 million bpd in 2016. Brent crude oil prices were expected to remain broadly unchanged in 2018 as U.S. shale production is able to expand at these levels, effectively capping prices. “We can now see where the price elasticity is. As the price comes up to $52-$53 a barrel we start to see some uptick in activity, as it drops to $45, we start to see that curtailing.” “For 2018 something around $45-$55 a barrel is probably a good range,” Gilvary said.

PDVSA, who is facing delays to load and discharge tankers at its main crude port, Jose, will receive the cargo at the neighboring island of Curacao where it operates a storage facility, according to Thomson Reuters vessel tracking data. The number of tankers waiting to load and discharge at PDVSA’s Bullenbay terminal in Curacao has fallen in recent days, the data say, but it has not eased around Jose. The tanker Krymst was loaded with 500,000 barrels of West Texas Intermediate crude at the U.S. Gulf Coast on March 28. It will arrive in Curacao on Wednesday. China Oil, a unit of state-run China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), must deliver 2.7 million barrels of WTI crude in April, while BP must provide 2.7 million barrels of WTI in April and 2.7 million barrels of Nigeria’s Qua Iboe crude in May-June, acording to the tender’s results. The tender, along with another spot purchase of crude from PetroChina, will double PDVSA’s crude imports during the second quarter to some 95,000 barrels per day (bpd) that will be used for refining and also to dilute Venezuela’s extra heavy oil output. PDVSA, who started importing U.S. oil in January, is also about to discharge another U.S. crude cargo on tanker Ridgebury Sally B, which was loaded on March 28. Seller of this cargo is still unknown. Even though waiting times at Bullenbay have fallen allowing a bigger number of tankers to enter the terminal in recent days, the accumulation of vessels around Jose has not significantly decreased, according to Thomson Reuters data. Some 18 vessels were waiting to load crude or discharge diluents at Jose as of April 6, the data say, including a dozen tankers for exports and three for imports. The delays caused a 7 percent decline in Venezuelan crude exports to the United States last month. The tanker Orpheas, carrying 500,000 barrels of WTI bought by PDVSA from French Total, discharged on April 4 after a 13-day wait.

284,2017-10-31,2017,10.0,31,"Karolin Schaps, Ron Bousso",BP revives share buybacks as years of austerity pay off,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP (BP.L) will become the first major European oil and gas company to resume share buybacks since the 2014 price slump, a sign years of austerity have paid off. Tuesday’s surprise announcement came as the British oil company reported a doubling in third-quarter profit, and in a week crude prices hit two year highs above $60 a barrel. Coupled with strong growth in its oil and gas production and cash flow, the resumption of buybacks in the fourth quarter lifted BP’s shares to their highest in over three years, when oil prices were still around $100 a barrel. The move comes as BP gradually shakes off the impact of the deadly 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill, known as Macondo, that cost it over $63 billion in clean-up costs and penalties. “After three years of oil price correction and seven years after Macondo we are now back into more normal state of growing the business in current environment and we can deal with prices that go lower,” BP Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary told Reuters. BP is the first among Europe’s top oil and gas companies to reintroduce buybacks, although some are making other moves to woo shareholders. Norway’s Statoil STL.OL, for example, has said it will stop offering a “scrip” dividend - paid in shares rather than cash - in the fourth quarter, while France’s Total (TOTF.PA) plans to do so next year. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) reports results on Thursday. “Today’s announcement is a very positive surprise, emphasizing the progress made in the reset of the BP in the aftermath of Macondo and in the context of lower oil prices,” UBS analysts said. In one of the clearest signs yet that the oil company has turned a corner, BP said it was able to balance its books so far this year at $49 a barrel, excluding Macondo payments, as years of cost cuts pay off. Four months ago, BP’s breakeven level was still at around $60 a barrel. BP will be able to balance its books at $50 or even $45 a barrel next year, Gilvary said. The London-based firm is working on an assumption Brent crude will average $50-55 a barrel next year as global inventories gradually return to normal, he added. The fortunes of Europe’s other top oil and gas companies diverged in the third quarter, with Italy’s ENI (ENI.MI) and Statoil missing profit expectations, while Total benefited from higher production and an increase in earnings at its huge downstream business. BP also got a boost from growing production after it started six major projects so far this year, as well as lower payments for the Macondo spill. BP’s oil and gas production in the first nine months of the year rose by more than 9.6 percent from a year earlier to 2.427 million barrels of oil equivalent. It also saw improved earnings in its downstream business where refinery profit margins rose sharply after Hurricane Harvey knocked out around a quarter of U.S. refininig capacity for several weeks. At 0915 GMT, BP shares were up 3.6 percent at 519.71 pence, after trading as high as 522.2 pence. The oil major reported third-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, the company’s definition of net income, of $1.87 billion, exceeding analysts’ forecast of $1.58 billion. The company generated $1.8 billion in surplus cash over the first nine months of the year, compared with $1.4 billion in shares issued as part of the scrip dividend. As of the current quarter, BP will buy back the equivalent number of shares it is issuing as part of its scrip dividend scheme through which investors can opt to receive dividend payouts in shares rather than cash. It will buy back around $1.6 billion worth of shares a year in order to offset the dilutive effect of the scrip dividend program, Gilvary said. “The move to start buybacks is welcomed by us to neutralize the scrip dividend and reduce the discount the market puts on the yield,” said Rohan Murphy, energy analyst at BP shareholder Allianz Global Investors.

The corporate support for the plan, which would impose a $40 tax on each ton of carbon dioxide produced, follows a decision by President Donald Trump to pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement, a global pact that fights climate change by slashing emissions from burning fossil fuels. “This plan would achieve significantly greater emissions reductions than all current and prior climate regulations, while helping America’s businesses and workers get ahead,” according to the advertisement from the Climate Leadership Council. The ad bore the corporate symbols of companies such as Exxon, BP, Shell, Total, GM, Johnson & Johnson, and PepsiCo. The Climate Leadership Council proposal was co-authored by James Baker, secretary of state during the administration of George H. W. Bush, and George Shultz, secretary of state under Ronald Reagan. The proposed $40 per ton tax on carbon would rise in price over time, and revenues would be paid into the Social Security Administration. While the plan echoes past attempts by parts of the Republican Party to address climate change, it could be a non-starter. Trump has expressed doubt over the existence of climate change and has said efforts to fight it put the United States at a competitive disadvantage. A White House official did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The administration has previously said a carbon tax is not under consideration. An overwhelming majority of scientists believe that burning fossil fuels drives global climate change, has raised sea levels and triggered more frequent and powerful storms. Oil giants like Exxon and BP have been criticized for their roles in contributing to climate change through the production and marketing of fossil fuels. Still, in recent years, they have supported government efforts to regulate emissions, including through the Paris climate deal agreed by nearly 200 nations in 2015.

The Azeri Central East (ACE) platform, the latest phase of Azerbaijan’s giant Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) oilfields, is expected to produce 100,000 barrels of oil a day and cost $6 billion to build, the company said. The project is one of the biggest upstream investment decisions in Azerbaijan so far this year. The ACG fields, which have so far produced 3.5 billion barrels of oil, have the potential to yield another 3 billion barrels. BP’s main aim now would be to maximize the extraction of remaining reserves, Robert Morris, senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said in a statement. “ACE is central to those plans, adding 100,000 barrels per day of production at peak in the mid-2020s,” he said. BP and Azerbaijan in 2017 extended their agreement to develop the ACG fields to 2050, a deal dubbed by the Azeri government as “the contract of the century” when first signed in 1994. The arrangement was initially due to run until 2024. Separately, SOCAR and its partners at the BP-led ACG consortium plan to participate in a tender to acquire stakes being sold by two of its members, Exxon Mobil and Chevron.

288,2016-04-22,2016,4.0,22,,British BP ships U.S. crude to PDVSA's terminal: sources,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - British BP has shipped a U.S. crude cargo to PDVSA’s terminal in Curacao, the third one that the firm has sent since winning a tender along with China Oil last month to provide the Venezuelan state-run company with some 8 million barrels of light oil, according to sources and Reuters data. Venezuela started regular crude purchases last year and since then it has been launching tenders on the open market for at least one monthly cargo. In March it decided to secure provisions for the whole second quarter, doubling crude imports to some 95,000 barrels per day (bpd). The tanker NS Century chartered by BP loaded crude this week at Beaumont and Port Arthur, Texas, on the U.S. Gulf Coast and set sail to PDVSA’s Bullenbay terminal on the Caribbean island of Curacao. It is scheduled to arrive on April 28. Another three tankers loaded with crude and dirty products loaded on the U.S. Gulf Coast are waiting to discharge at Bullenbay amid a backlog of vessels around some PDVSA’s ports due to equipment failure at its main oil terminal, Jose. The Aframax tanker Krymsk, sent by BP as first delivery from the light crude tender, has been waiting to discharge since April 6. Tankers Angelica Schulte, which arrived in Curacao on April 17, and Paramount Hatteras, which arrived on Friday, also have not discharged. A shipper close to the sale said one of the cargoes could contain vacuum gasoil (VGO) for PDVSA’s Isla refinery in Curacao. BP must deliver 2.7 million barrels of U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude to PDVSA in April in cargoes of 550,000 barrels each, and it also will provide 2.7 million barrels of Nigeria’s Qua Iboe crude in May-June. For its part, China Oil, which last week delivered its first WTI crude cargo to PDVSA after a nine-day wait, must send 2.7 million barrels of U.S. crude, according to the tender’s terms. But deliveries might not be made on time if delays persist. As of April 22, 16 tankers were waiting to load and discharge at Jose port and other 14 vessels were anchored around Curacao. Wait time has double to at least seven days, from a standard of three to four days, according to Thomson Reuters vessel tracking data. PDVSA has said Jose port is working without delays.

289,2017-09-14,2017,9.0,14,"Ron Bousso, Dmitry Zhdannikov, Karolin Schaps",BP sees strong profits in renewed Azeri oil contract,"LONDON (Reuters) - A deal by BP to extend oil production-sharing in Azerbaijan by 25 years is profitable at current oil prices even after paying a signing bonus and cutting foreign companies’ stake in the project, Chief Executive Bob Dudley said. The pact between a BP-led consortium and Azerbaijan to continue developing the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) offshore fields until 2050 comes as the oil and gas company prepares to boost production sharply by the end of the decade. Under the deal, BP and its partners cede part of their stake to Azerbaijan’s national energy company SOCAR and pay the government a $3.6 billion signing bonus. BP’s stake falls to 30.37 percent from 35.8 percent but it will remain the operator. The initial agreement, signed in 1994, was dubbed by some as “the contract of the century” for its transformative impact on the Azeri economy. Speaking from Baku, Dudley said in an interview the renewed deal is profitable with oil currently around $55 a barrel and that it remains attractive within BP’s portfolio even as crude prices are not expected to rise sharply this decade. “It is very good, solid economics for everyone involved,” the BP CEO told Reuters on Thursday. “Breakeven is below the current price of oil ... it is competitive in our portfolio, most certainly.” BP, like its peers, has sharply cut spending over the past three years following a drop in oil prices, slashing costs for projects and laying off thousands of employees. “You can only imagine at a time when oil prices have dropped like they have in recent years that we are very selective about where we make our investments,” he said. The London-based company is on track to start production this year at seven major projects around the world, including the giant Eni-operated Zohr gas field in Egypt. “We will see all seven projects come on through 2017 and lay the foundation towards 800,000 barrels per day of new production by 2020,” Dudley said. The new deal structure will lead to a small decrease in the international consortium’s production. Analysts at investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co estimated the new contract would lead to a drop of around 15,000 barrels per day in BP’s 2018 production, which is seen reaching around 3.7 million barrels of oil and gas equivalent per day. BP shares closed virtually unchanged on Thursday.

291,2017-06-27,2017,6.0,27,Jessica Resnick-Ault,"In disaster's wake, BP doubles down on deepwater despite surging shale","THUNDER HORSE OIL PLATFORM, Gulf of Mexico (Reuters) - About 300 BP workers commute 150 miles here by helicopter, from the Louisiana coast to a deep-sea drilling platform that can produce more oil in a day than a West Texas rig can pump in a year. On the deck of Thunder Horse, they work two-week shifts, drink seawater from a desalination plant, and eat ribs and chicken ferried in by boat. On the ocean floor, robots provide remote eyes and arms as drills extract up to 265,000 barrels per day. “There’s a whole city below us,” said Jim Pearl, Marine Team Leader on the platform. This is just one of the four Gulf of Mexico platforms on which BP has staked its future in U.S. oil production. Seven years after its Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill, BP is betting tens of billions of dollars on the prospect that it can slash the costs of offshore drilling by half or more - just as shale oil producers have done onshore. The firm says it can do that while it continues to pay an estimated $61 billion in total costs and damages from the worst spill in history - and without compromising safety. BP’s Gulf platforms are key to a global strategy calling for up to $17 billion in annual investments through 2021 to increase production by about 5 percent each year, Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley recently told investors. “Our strategy is to take this investment that we spent so much money building, and keep it full” to the platform’s capacity, Richard Morrison, BP’s regional president for the Gulf of Mexico, told Reuters during the first tour of a BP Gulf drilling platform since the disaster. “We’re also exploring for larger pools of oil.” BP’s deepwater double-down is all the more striking for the contrast to its chief competitors, who have cooled on offshore investments in light of the lower costs and quicker returns of onshore shale plays. While BP has some onshore U.S. developments, the firm is notably absent from the industry’s rush into shale oil fields of the West Texas Permian Basin. Majors including Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) have maintained Gulf operations but focused expansions on U.S. shale. Exxon Mobil doubled its acreage in the Permian in a deal earlier this year. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX.N) and Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) have pulled out of Gulf drilling entirely in recent years. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) took a $435-million dollar write-down in May on its Shenandoah project in the Gulf, deciding it could not profit with oil prices hovering at about $50 a barrel. “In a $50 to $60 world, we always felt like greenfield development, in the Gulf in particular, was fairly challenged,” Anadarko CEO Al Walker told investors last month. Oil prices dropped steeply last week, settling in the low $40s per barrel. BP says its next Gulf development - the $9 billion Mad Dog phase two - would be profitable even at $40 a barrel. As recently as 2013, BP reported that it could not start new deepwater Gulf projects at prices lower than $100 a barrel. In time, BP’s offshore expansion could produce a huge payoff. The firm announced last month that it had discovered an additional billion barrels of oil below its four audaciously named Gulf platforms - Thunder Horse, Atlantis, Na Kika and Mad Dog. The find - worth more than $40 billion at today’s market prices - amounts to more than three times the proven reserves at the Na Kika field, or the equivalent of three new fields in the Gulf. “It seems like every ten years there’s another breakthrough” that unlocks more Gulf oil, Morrison said on the deck of Thunder Horse. Over his shoulder, a drillship three miles away tapped a new well that will feed production into the massive platform. In the wake of the 2010 BP disaster, deepwater production was curtailed by a six-month U.S. government moratorium on drilling and a longer period of uncertainty about regulation. But output has rebounded to new record highs as projects sanctioned years ago start operations and existing hubs such as Thunder Horse expand. BP’s big new discovery is key to its slashing of estimated per-barrel costs, as are a host of drilling innovations and more favorable deals with service providers. For eight decades, geologists have used seismic imaging to estimate oil and gas reserves beneath the rocky undersea terrain. BP used its own new technology for the billion-barrel discovery. Called full waveform inversion, the technique uses massive amounts of data to create a high-resolution model of reserves that were previously hidden beneath salt deposits. The firm also aims to tap those reserves without building new multi-billion-dollar platforms. At Thunder Horse and other platforms, BP is installing wellheads on the seabed and connecting them to pipelines that rise up to existing platforms, like the legs of a spider. These “tiebacks” allow producers to feed oil from remote regions of fields that previously went untapped. Other design changes helped BP hold down the investment in Mad Dog’s second phase from an initially estimated $20 billion to just $9 billion, the company said. Such savings are part of the equation BP uses to estimate the platform’s profitability at oil prices of $40 a barrel. The struggles of deepwater oil service firms - who were forced to cut prices after per-barrel prices tanked in 2014 - are also keeping BP’s expansion costs low. “If you’re going to be building an offshore Gulf of Mexico platform, now is the time to be doing it,” said Norm MacDonald, portfolio manager for Invesco’s energy fund, which has increased its stake in BP, its second-largest holding. Other funds remain leery of offshore investments because of the longer wait for a return in a volatile industry. Shale has a “liquidity premium” because producers can make smaller investments and recoup them sooner, within two or three years, said Michael Roomberg, a portfolio analyst at Miller-Howard Investments. Tie-backs and other advances, however, could accelerate deepwater returns and help narrow the liquidity gap with shale, MacDonald said. BP’s growing deepwater investments irk some environmentalists, who say the company has fought paying what it owes to restore shorelines and communities damaged by its massive spill. They also see the threat of another disaster. “They never really fulfilled those promises, and people are very skeptical about them expanding drilling,” said Raleigh Hoke, campaign director at Gulf Restoration Network in New Orleans. Richard Sears - who served as chief scientist on the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling - said such projects can be managed safely at low oil prices. The causes of the BP disaster had more to do with poor decision-making and slipshod safety systems than cost-cutting, said Sears, who previously managed production projects at Shell. BP said it has bolstered safety operations globally since the spill, introducing a safety and operational risk staff with 800 positions and an internal global wells organization to standardize drilling practices, among other measures. The company says it cannot precisely estimate new spending on safety since the spill because its efforts are integrated into many parts of the company. In a glassed-in drilling shack on the Thunder Horse platform, operators stay connected to a new onshore command center in Houston that BP designed to monitor data from offshore wells. On the deck below sits a blowout preventer, a room-sized piece of equipment that would soon be fitted on the wellhead of a drilling site, two miles under water. But first it would need a safety inspection - unlike the blowout preventer that infamously failed to contain the 2010 spill, which federal regulators have said had not been inspected in years.

Two shareholder advisers, Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, have also recommended rejecting the BP executives’ 2015 remuneration packages, saying they were too generous considering the British oil and gas company’s poor financial performance. BP has proposed increasing Dudley’s remuneration by 20 percent and paying executives maximum bonuses despite posting its biggest-ever annual loss following a near 70 percent slump in oil prices. “This proposed increase is both unreasonable and insensitive ... We will be voting against this proposal,” said Ashley Hamilton Claxton, corporate governance manager at Royal London Asset Management, which holds 0.7 percent of BP shares worth more than 400 million pounds ($564 million). ISS said BP’s remuneration report was flawed because directors receive maximum bonus payments without hitting all targets. “BP’s performance surpassed the board’s expectations on almost all of the measures that determine remuneration - and the outcome reflects this,” a BP spokesman said. Shrinking profit margins have forced BP to slash costs across the board, resulting in more than 5,000 job losses at the company last year.

BP, which plans to lay off around 7,000 workers by the end of next year, said it was expecting further charges related to redundancies and other restructuring measures next year, adding to the $2.1 billion in charges incurred since the end of 2014. BP’s third-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, the company’s definition of net income, fell to $933 million from $1.8 billion a year earlier but beat the $780 million expected by analysts. “We remain on track to rebalance organic cash flows next year at $50 to $55 a barrel,” Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary said in a statement. Oil prices are now trading at around $49 a barrel, meaning BP is banking on a slight rise in prices going into next year. To achieve a leaner balance sheet, BP said it would lower its 2016 capital expenditure to around $16 billion from the $17-19 billion expected at the start of the year, and target $15-17 billion for 2017. BP joined the ranks of Shell, France’s Total and U.S. majors Exxon Mobil and Chevron in beating expectations, with cost cuts helping to improve margins. Norway’s Statoil and Italy’s ENI disappointed, however. BP said asset sales stood at $2.7 billion at the end of the quarter and the company remained on track to sell $3-5 billion of assets this year.

Hundreds of workers on Norwegian offshore oil and gas rigs went on strike on Tuesday after rejecting a proposed wage deal, closing Shell’s Knarr field, which produces 23,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Four days in and the conflicting parties were still not talking to each other, a union official and a mediator told Reuters on Friday. Aker BP Chief Executive Karl Johnny Hersvik said activity at the Valhall IP water injection and Valhall DP drilling platforms would stop if the strike escalated. “If the strike is prolonged it will have later in the year impact on when wells are back in production ... if that is going to happen it means the strike has to be quite long,” he said during the firm’s second-quarter results presentation. Aker BP later told Reuters a strike of a month to six weeks could impact output at the field by “a few thousands barrels per day”. “Some of the wells that are drilled are planned to be put in production at the end of this year. If the strike lasts, the output will move to next year, which would have an impact on this year’s production outlook,” investor relations contact Kjetil Bakken said. In the short term, Aker BP plans to use any lost drilling time to perform maintenance and activities to raise the flow of oil and gas, Hersvik said. Aker BP holds a 90 percent stake in the Valhall field, which produced 13.5 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2017. The firm has plans to increase production. Just two days before 901 more oil workers could walk out, Norway’s Safe union and the country’s Shipowners’ Association, representing employers, have yet to talk to each other, the union’s negotiator said. “So far there is no contact.

296,2016-06-29,2016,6.0,29,,BP receives its first Venezuelan crude cargo under swap deal,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Britain’s BP Plc this month received a Venezuelan crude cargo from state-run PDVSA, according to Thomson Reuters trade flows data, the first since the companies agreed on a swap arrangement to settle pending payments for U.S. oil shipments. BP and China Oil won a tender launched by PDVSA in March to be supplied with U.S. and African light oil during the second quarter of this year. The light oil is needed to dilute Venezuela’s extra heavy output and for processing at Caribbean refineries. After cash-strapped PDVSA did not make payments on time, BP in May halted further discharges of cargoes of U.S. crude at the port of Curacao. Then a swap agreement was reached involving deliveries of Venezuelan oil to BP as payment for the U.S. crude, a source close to the talks said earlier in June. Aframax tanker Grimstad, chartered by BP and carrying some 500,000 barrels of Venezuelan Merey crude, arrived in Pascagoula Anchorage and Lightering Area in the U.S. Gulf Coast on June 11. It has been waiting to discharge since then. BP has not had access to Venezuelan crude since 2013, when its unit TNK-BP sold its stake in a crude upgrader at the Orinoco belt to Russia’s Rosneft. BP still needs to receive more cargoes from PDVSA to cover all payments it is owed and this is why several BP tankers have still yet to unload in Curacao, according to traders. As of June 29, 2.05 million barrels of U.S. crude in three tankers are still waiting to unload, while a fourth cargo entered PDVSA’s Bullenbay terminal in Curacao this week to start delivering. A unit of Russia’s oil company Lukoil has also been importing cargoes of Venezuelan crude in the United States since late 2015 under a similar swap agreement with PDVSA.

299,2019-02-11,2019,2.0,11,"Nadine Awadalla, Aidan Lewis","Egypt to see gas boost from BP fields, Zohr as Cairo returns to export market","CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt’s gas output will get a boost this year as the country’s huge Zohr field nears peak production and with $1.8 billion in investment from BP, officials said on Monday, as Egypt returns to export markets and positions itself as a regional hub. Egypt hopes to leverage its strategic location and well-developed infrastructure to become a key international trading and distribution center for gas, a potentially remarkable turnaround for a country that spent about $3 billion on annual liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports as recently as 2016. It has made a series of big discoveries in recent years, including Zohr, the largest gas field in the Mediterranean, helping to draw back investors that had pulled away after a 2011 uprising led to mounting debt payments. “What we have achieved in only three years has started to attract the attention of everybody — everybody in oil and gas industry, financial organizations ... everyone is looking to Egypt with interest,” Petroleum Minister Tarek El Molla told an energy forum in Cairo. Egypt is now hoping to tap long underutilized liquefaction plants, where gas is turned into LNG, to export supplies across the Mediterranean along with that of its neighbors, like Israel, which said it would pipe gas to Egypt later this year. Egypt imported its final natural gas shipment last September, and said it will begin exporting to Jordan this year, though the exact level of shipments and timeline is still unclear. Its domestic production level stands at about 6.6 billion cubic feet per day. BP said in September it will spend about $1.8 billion this year getting several fields online, making Egypt its largest investment destination worldwide for a second year running. “For the last two years in a row we’ve invested more money in Egypt than in any other country,” BP CEO Bob Dudley said at the conference. “So this is a deep, deep commitment to Egypt.” Total production at BP’s West Nile Development will soar to nearly 1.4 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) after the project’s third field, Raven, comes online. About 700 million cubic feet per day will come online by April from the first two, Giza and Fayoum, Molla said. The country’s top gas asset, Zohr, discovered by Eni in 2015, will near peak production of about 3 bcfd from 2.1 billion currently by the end of 2019, Molla said, further boosting potential export capacity. Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne said the French oil major is considering developing downstream petrochemicals in Egypt after having acquired a stake in Idku, one of its two liquefaction plants. Eni, which owns a stake in the country’s other liquefied natural gas plant in Damietta along with Spain’s Gas Natural has said the long idle plant should restore operations this year. “There is no date, however there is a strong interest for all involved parties in having Damietta restart as soon as possible,” said Eni Chief Midstream Gas and Power Office Massimo Mantovani. Molla said results of two exploration tenders held last year for 27 blocks would be announced during the three-day forum, and that it had seen “high turnout” from international companies. He said about 80 percent of arrears to international oil companies had been paid, but did not specify the amount left. In July they stood at $1.2 billion.

Luaibi, who met BP’s president for the Middle East region Michael Townshend, has asked the British oil major to help increase output from Kirkuk oilfield to more than 700,000 barrels per day, the spokesman said. “The minister is very keen to rehabilitate the Kirkuk oilfield and raise production from there as soon as possible,” spokesman Asim Jihad told Reuters. The oil minister discussed reactivating a deal signed in 2013 with BP to revive Iraq’s northern Kirkuk oilfield and help Baghdad arrest a huge decline in output from Kirkuk and increase production to higher levels, said Jihad. Kirkuk is one of the biggest and oldest oilfields in the Middle East, still estimated to contain around 9 billion barrels of recoverable oil, according to BP. BP has provided technical assistance in the past to the Iraqi state-owned North Oil Company to aid the redevelopment of the Kirkuk field. “BP and the oil ministry will form a joint team to visit Kirkuk oilfield and study the situation on the ground to survey the oilfield,” said the spokesman without giving a timing for when the visit could happen. Kirkuk has become the key area of tensions between Baghdad and Kurdish regional authorities since Iraqi Kurdistan held an independence referendum in September, triggering an angry response from Baghdad and neighboring Turkey and Iran. Kurdistan’s Peshmerga forces pulled out from Kirkuk oilfields last week as Iraqi military advanced on the area that is responsible for a half of Kurdistan’s oil production, or around 300,000 barrels per day. The retreat of Peshmerga forces allowed Baghdad to take control of all oil fields operated by state-owned North Oil Company in the Kirkuk northern province.

BP fell 9 percent, its biggest daily decline since mid-June 2010, after reporting its worst annual loss in more than 20 years in 2015 and announced thousands of job cuts. It maintained its dividend, but the weak results and outlook are likely to put pressure on the company, which has had to increase borrowing . “BP’s dividend is a mile away from being covered by earnings and the market is saying that this is unsustainable,” said Steve Clayton, head of equities research at Hargreaves Lansdown.” They are a chasm away from their cash break-even oil price of around $60 dollars per barrel.” The pan-European FTSEurofirst index < .FTEU3> dropped 2.2 percent by 1504 GMT, after closing 0.2 percent weaker on Monday. The index is down 8.5 percent so far this year. The STOXX Europe 600 Oil and Gas index dropped 5.3 percent as Brent oil fell more than 5 percent, hit by worries about demand and rising supply. Hopes for a deal between OPEC and Russia to cut output faded. Shares in Reposol, Royal Dutch Shell, Eni and Total all fell between 4.5 and 6 percent. BHP Billiton fell 7.3 percent after Standard & Poor’s cut its credit rating and warned it might be lowered further if measures to shore up cash levels were not taken. BHP is now expected to cut its dividend by half. Swiss bank UBS also slumped, falling 7.6 percent, after reporting a surprise outflow of funds from its flagship wealth management business. That overshadowed its best results since 2010 and a higher-than-expected dividend. Infineon fell 4.8 percent after disappointing guidance on margins. Shares in Danske Bank rose 3.9 percent after the company reported fourth-quarter pretax profit that beat forecasts, thanks to higher trading income. The Danish bank also plans to buy back shares. Sainsbury’s rose 2.3 percent after saying it had agreed to buy Argos-owner Home Retail for 1.3 billion pounds ($1.87 billion) to expand its online business. Sainsbury’s said it expected the offer to improve earnings per share in the first full year following completion.

The internationally exposed FTSE rose 0.3 percent at 7,513 points by 0929 GMT after a 0.2 percent fall seen on Monday when strength in the pound ahead of this week’s Bank of England policy meeting weighed. The stock index is on track to end October up 1.8 percent, its best month in five. BP rose as much as 4.1 percent to its highest level in three years since July 2014 after a strong update in a sector supported by the reecent surge of crude oil prices to above $60. BP said it will resume share buybacks after reporting a doubling in third-quarter profit in the clearest sign yet that the oil company is confident about a turnaround. “The turnaround in BP’s fortunes since 2010 has been a very long road and CEO Bob Dudley has managed to navigate a very tricky road,” Michael Hewson, Chief Market Analyst at CMC Markets UK, wrote in a note. Gains in BP were mirrored by strenght in Royal Dutch Shell , up more than 1 percent, making the energy the biggest lift to the FTSE, adding 20 points to the index. Analysts at Barclays said fund managers globally remained underweight on the energy sector in spite of the rally in crude prices and cost cutting by big oil firms to operate profitably with oil prices at $50. “As we head into year-end and early 2018 we expect yet more evidence to emerge of the re-set that the oil industry has gone through and with the energy sector offering close to the highest premium of dividends to the market for nearly 30 years, this should in turn lead to a re-rating,” they said. Elsewhere, chemicals maker Croda was the second biggest gainer on the FTSE, up more than 3 percent after a trading update. WPP fell as much as 2.7 percent after the world’s biggest advertising company lowered expectations for full-year organic net sales and profit margin, two months after an earlier downgrade sent shockwaves through the industry. The stock however recovered ground to turn positive, up 1 percent as the focus returned to better than expected quarterly net sales performance. Liberum said the guidance cut was partly expected and would not impact consensus earnings too much. “We remain positive on the longer-term fundamentals but sentiment is likely to be subdued until WPP can stop the downgrade cycle,” it said in a note. London-listed shares in rose 5 after Europe’s largest airline by passenger numbers reassured investors by saying it was on course to post record annual profits despite a rostering mess-up that forced it to cancel 20,000 flights. Just Eat rose 4.3 percent after the takeaway ordering website raised its full-year revenue guidance for the second time in four months after reporting a 47 percent increase in its latest quarter on the back of strong order growth. Among mid caps, Weir Group slumped 5 percent. The maker of pipes and valves for mining and energy industries lowered its full-year operating profit forecast due to higher costs and investments in its mining business. The mid cap index inched up 0.1 percent. Shares in bookmakers Ladbrokes Coral and William Hill rose 2.2 and 1 percent respectively, shrugging off news that the maximum stake on gambling machines in betting shops could be sharply cut in response to concerns that the terminals fuel addiction. The top stake could be cut from 100 pounds to between 50 pounds and as little as 2 pounds, the government said, starting a 12-week consultation period. Analysts at Barclays said it believed a cut to 2 pounds was not the most likely outcome.

The other bidders are the field’s current operator Maersk , as well as Total SA, Chevron Corp and ConocoPhillips, said the people who spoke on condition of anonymity as the information was private. The people said state-owned Qatar Petroleum (QP) would award the contract for the oil field, which is 80 kilometres (50 miles) off Qatar’s coast and currently produces around 300,000 barrels per day (bpd), in the second half of the year. Officials at Maersk, Chevron, Conoco and Qatar Petroleum did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Shell and BP declined to comment. A Total spokesman said CEO Patrick Pouyanne had confirmed its bid earlier this month. Denmark’s A.P. Moller-Maersk, which owns Maersk Oil Qatar, said on May 4 it was involved in a tender process and there was a risk it could lose the Qatari field, its largest oil producer. For years it was expected Maersk would renew its 25-year production agreement on Al Shaheen field when its licence runs out in 2017. But the Gulf state surprised the company last year by putting out a tender for the field which Maersk Oil has been operating since 1992. A Qatari oil source told Reuters the Gulf state had invited international majors to the tender because it wanted to raise production at the field to 500,000 bpd. Maersk Oil had originally planned for Al Shaheen’s production to reach 525,000 bpd by 2010, after a 2005 field development plan was approved, but output remained at about 300,000 bpd, roughly half of Qatar’s daily crude output. The oil reservoirs are notoriously thin and spread out across a vast area, making production difficult. BP withdrew from a $4.3 billion project to build Qatar’s first liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant in 1992, stating it saw no financial benefits to staying in the project. Since then, Qatar, a country of 2.6 million, has gone on to become the world’s richest by per capita income and the largest producer of LNG, which is gas chilled to liquid for export on specially designed ships. A senior BP company executive told Reuters in 2007 it was eyeing a return to Qatar’s upstream gas sector after a 15-year hiatus and was interested in offshore exploration areas and taking part in projects to produce more difficult gas reserves in Qatar.

306,2017-11-24,2017,11.0,24,Ron Bousso,A BP North Sea field to test U.S. policy on Iran,"LONDON (Reuters) - A small gas field on the edge of the British North Sea could become a litmus test for U.S. policy towards Iran. London-based BP this week agreed to sell to North Sea producer Serica Energy three fields in the ageing offshore basin, including the Rhum field which is co-owned by a subsidiary of Iran’s national oil company. For Serica, the $400 million deal will increase its production sevenfold. It nevertheless hinges on the British company receiving a licence from U.S. sanctions enforcement authorities at a time when President Donald Trump is flexing his muscles against Tehran. For BP and its American Chief Executive Bob Dudley, selling Rhum, which BP discovered in the 1970s, removes a potential source of friction as it mends its ties with the U.S. government following the deadly 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Rhum was shut down for most of the first half of the decade due to western sanctions on Tehran before resuming normal operations in 2016 following a landmark nuclear deal between Iran and the world’s top powers. Because of the Iranian involvement, BP needs a licence from the U.S. Treasury’s sanctions enforcement arm - the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) - allowing U.S. nationals and companies to take part in the field’s operations. The licence was renewed in September, a month before Trump sought to reverse the U.S. position on the nuclear deal with Iran. Serica will apply for its own licence in the coming months, Tony Craven Walker, Serica’s Executive Chairman, told Reuters. “Getting an OFAC licence for Serica to assume operatorship of Rhum is part of the conditions of the transaction with BP,” Walker said. OFAC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. BP, founded more than a century ago as the Anglo-Persian oil company, will lobby the British government to lend its support in requesting the U.S. administration to grant the licence to Serica, according to a source at BP. Though not a prerequisite to operate the field, the licence is needed as a back-up in case of an emergency that requires U.S. equipment and companies, Walker said. “Given the nature of the operations and our intentions to meet the same obligations as BP we don’t foresee any reason for the licence not to be granted,” Walker said. France’s Total, which recently opened an office in Washington, is also closely monitoring the U.S. position on Iran which could decide the fate of its plans to develop a huge offshore gas field in Iran. SNAP-BACK Things could change quickly after Trump’s decision in October not to certify that Tehran is complying with the nuclear deal. The ball now lies in the court of the U.S. Congress, which will decide next month whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the agreement. “A snap-back of U.S sanctions is a risk,” Walker said. “But it does not necessarily impact our operations in Rhum unless the European Union and UK also implement a snap-back and there is no indication that this is likely to occur.” Serica board member Jeffrey Harris, a U.S. citizen, stepped down in order to guarantee it does not violate U.S. sanctions still in place that ban Americans from dealing with Iran. Serica hopes to complete the acquisition of the Bruce, Keith and Rhum fields from BP by mid-2018. The deal will increase its production to around 21,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which around 85 percent is gas. Serica and its partner, Iranian Oil Company, plan to renew drilling of a third well at the Rhum field next year, Walker said. After being forced to shut down in 2010 when Western nations imposed sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear program, Rhum resumed production in 2013 when Britain agreed to set up a temporary management scheme whereby all revenue due to Tehran would be held until sanctions were lifted. Following the removal of European Union and United Nations sanctions on Iran in January 2016, the temporary management scheme ceased but BP still obtained an OFAC licence.

307,2018-04-27,2018,4.0,27,Timothy Gardner,U.S. seeks revision of rule on offshore oil wells made after BP disaster,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Friday proposed relaxing a rule on offshore oil wells that was finalized after the 2010 BP Plc disaster and crude spill in the Gulf of Mexico, as part of its effort to slash regulations it considers burdensome on industry. The exact revisions to the 2016 well control rule proposed by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), an office of the Department of Interior, will be known next week when they are published in the Federal Register. But the proposed changes will include removing “prescriptive requirements” for real-time monitoring of offshore drilling facilities and allow the oil producers to use company-specific approaches, a BSEE fact sheet said. The proposed revisions will also seek to minimize what BSEE says are duplicative notifications of rig movements that operators are required to send to the agency. In addition, independent third-party groups would be allowed to do some certifications and verifications on parts of blow-out preventers, which seek to stop the uncontrolled releases of crude, according to the fact sheet. The 2010 Macondo disaster killed 11 oil rig workers, was the biggest environmental disaster in U.S. history, and has cost BP about $65 billion. While drilling interests had pushed the agency to revise the rule, Scott Angelle, the director of BSEE, said in a blog that the agency would never put offshore workers or the environment at greater risk. “At the same time, we are equally dedicated to addressing overly burdensome regulations and, even more so, to amending or eliminating regulations that may decrease safety or increase the chances of environmental harm,” he said. Randall Luthi, the president of National Ocean Industries Association, said changes to the rule would increase efficiency and “do not, in any way, constitute a rollback in offshore safety.” U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, was concerned the revisions would weaken the offshore regulations. “These rules were put in place to prevent another massive oil spill off our coasts,” he said. “We can’t allow this new administration to take us backwards in time.” The proposal will be published next week and open to a 60-day public comment period.

BP was the largest shareholder in New Zealand’s only oil refiner before it sold the stock in block trade on Thursday night at NZ$2.32 per share, stock exchange filings show, below Thursday’s closing price of NZ$2.49. Shares in the company, which had been in a trading halt due to the transaction, fell 4 percent to NZ$2.39 when they resumed trading on Friday afternoon. New Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index was up 0.2 percent on the day. “BP regularly undertakes reviews of its assets, partnerships and shareholdings around the world and today’s transaction is the outcome of one such global portfolio review,” BP’s head of Asia-Pacific fuels Andy Holmes said in a statement. BP did not disclose the buyer of the stake, but said in a statement that it had retained an 10.1-percent interest in the company, via local subsidiaries. “BP’s reduction in shareholding does not affect the existing contractual arrangements between Refining NZ and BP, including the processing agreement,” New Zealand Refining said in a statement.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 index rose 0.3 percent to 6,281.50 points, slightly below a 4-month high reached last week. A 4.3 percent rise at BP added the most points to the FTSE. BP posted an 80 percent drop in first quarter profits but still beat analysts’ expectations. It maintained its dividend and said it could cut capital spending further. “Overall it’s a good set of figures as it looks like BP is getting costs under control,” said Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital. Banking group Standard Chartered surged over 11 percent after its profit rebounded in the first quarter, as reduced loan losses offered signs of a turnaround following a loss-making 2015. The stock was set for its biggest daily gain since May 2010, lifting the UK banking index which rose 2.7 percent. “Q1 results ... show the group has moved back into profit on both underlying and reported bases, reflecting a sharp reduction in impairments compared to the final quarter of last year,” Gary Greenwood, analyst at Shore Capital, said, adding a note of caution on the bank’s outlook. “We believe the road to recovery is a long one and that the shares are likely to remain highly volatile in the near-term. We therefore retain a neutral stance.” Shares in Whitbread, which runs Premier Inn hotels and the Costa Coffee chain, rose 1.5 percent after reporting a rise in profits. Engineering firm Cobham, which is on the FTSE 250 mid-cap index, slumped more than 19 percent after proposing a 500 million pounds ($724.80 million) rights issue to strengthen its balance sheet after issuing a profit warning. “As earnings have been essentially static for some time, it is unlikely that the market will rehabilitate a better financed Cobham until true organic growth is demonstrated by the company,” Andy Chambers, analyst at Edison Investment Research, said in a note. The FTSE 100 is up around 0.6 percent so far in 2016, but nearly 12 percent below a record high reached in April 2015.

311,2016-02-26 00:00:00,2016,2.0,26,,Former BP rig supervisor found not guilty in oil spill case,"(Reuters) - A former BP Plc supervisor was found not guilty by a New Orleans jury on Thursday of a single pollution charge stemming from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon drilling disaster that killed 11 people. Robert Kaluza was the last of four people who had faced charges in connection with the disaster, the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history. Kaluza, along with another former well-site manager, was accused of ignoring warning signs and botching safety testing that resulted in the rupture and explosion of BP’s Macondo well, sending millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. A jury on Thursday found Kaluza not guilty of a single misdemeanor count of violating the U.S. Clean Water Act. If convicted, he could have faced up to a year in jail. A spokesman for the U.S. Justice Department declined to comment on the jury’s decision. Kaluza and Donald Vidrine, the two highest-ranking supervisors on board the Deepwater Horizon rig, had initially faced charges of manslaughter and violating the Clean Water Act. The federal government dismissed involuntary manslaughter charges against the men, saying a review after the incident determined the case did not meet the criteria for gross negligence. In March 2015, a federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling to drop charges of seamen’s manslaughter against Kaluza and Vidrine, saying that the men’s responsibilities on the rig did not constitute the “marine operations, maintenance and navigation” of a ship. Vidrine in December pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor violation of the Clean Water Act and was sentenced to probation, the Justice Department said. None of the four charged in the disaster have been sentenced to jail time. BP has sustained more than $42 billion in charges from the disaster aboard the rig. The company is awaiting a separate ruling from a New Orleans federal judge, expected some time this year, over its fines under the U.S. Clean Water Act.

BP said in the filing that Monroe Energy, a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines Inc , terminated the contract after misinterpreting a provision regarding the blending of crude oils. BP declined to comment further on the case and Monroe could not be immediately reached. Monroe has yet to respond to the allegations in court. The dispute with Monroe marks at least the second time in the past two years that BP has been accused by a refiner of supplying lesser-grade crudes. NARL Refining is embroiled in an arbitration dispute with BP that involves allegations that the oil major was providing crude oil at the company’s Come-By-Chance refinery in Newfoundland, Canada, that helped BP’s profits but hurt the refinery’s equipment. Monroe Energy inked a three-year contract with BP in August 2014 to supply the company’s 185,000 barrel-per-day refinery outside Philadelphia with crude oil from the Eagle Ford or Bakken shale fields, according to the lawsuit filed on Thursday in U.S. District Court in Southern New York. Monroe agreed to pay $8.35 above the U.S. benchmark price for Eagle Ford and $7.35 above the U.S. benchmark for Bakken deliveries, according to the lawsuit. The supply contract was favorable for Monroe when U.S. crude sold at a wide discount against the global benchmark during the early months of the deal, but the spread narrowed significantly in late 2015, making global crude more attractive to East Coast refiners. Monroe notified BP last June that it was severing the contract, alleging the oil major was intentionally blending batches of Eagle Ford crude that did not meet the API gravity grade called for in the contract, according to the lawsuit. BP said the agreement had no language that barred it from commingling grades of crude oil from the same fields, court papers showed. BP says it blended batches of Eagle Ford crude from different wells, calling it a routine industry practice. BP also said Monroe used gravity figures measured at the docks in Texas, not at the point of delivery as required by contract, according to the lawsuit. Monroe never complained the delivered crude was not in compliance, BP said. “Monroe’s allegations were nothing more than an unfounded pretext to terminate the (contract),” BP said in the filing.

BP said in July it continued to reduce costs and expected 2016 capital expenditures to come in below the previous target of $17 billion, and investments could drop to as low as $15 billion in 2017 if crude prices remain weak. “I don’t think we need to and I don’t want to increase our capex for the rest of the decade. We’ve got to maintain that discipline,” Dudley said. He said BP’s Pan American Energy LLC unit in Argentina would follow the same trend, with 2017 investment seen similar to or less than 2016, but clarified BP is not “putting the brakes on.” The “vast majority” of spending cuts implemented after the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, one of the worst in U.S. history, were over, Dudley said. Dudley met with Argentina’s new President Mauricio Macri and with his finance and energy ministers this week, as nearly 2,000 executives visited Buenos Aires to hear the government’s pitch at the Argentina Business & Investment Forum. Macri won the presidency last year by promising to open Argentina’s economy to foreign investment. While companies generally speak enthusiastically about Macri’s policies, many are hesitant about Argentina’s notoriously volatile politics and economic crises. “(The forum) is to give us the confidence to know it will be stable going forward to be able to make decisions because we are in an industry where you make investment decisions 10 years out,” Dudley said. He reported being pleased with the “huge steps” made over the past nine months but said he would like to see infrastructure scaled up to bring down production costs as well as more labor flexibility. BP, like rival Royal Dutch Shell but unlike Exxon and Chevron, lent its support to last year’s climate agreement in Paris that commits to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. To help achieve that objective, Dudley said BP plans to expand natural gas production to 60 percent of its portfolio by the end of the decade, up from a current 50-50 split with oil. He added that the company was considering expanding renewable energy projects, including its biofuels operation in Brazil, despite the ongoing recession and political turmoil. The company employs 5,000 people at two large ethanol mills that Dudley described as “very successful.” “The crisis there has not really affected us,” Dudley said, adding that Pan American Energy was studying wind energy products in Argentina’s Patagonia region. Dudley reiterated expectations for oil prices to average around $50 a barrel in 2016, up from $44 last year, and said he expected prices “north of $50” in 2017. Dudley came under fire from shareholders earlier this year for taking a £14.13 million ($20 million) pay deal for 2015, up substantially from 2014, even though the company cut 5,000 jobs and reported steep losses as oil prices plunged. BP’s board initiated a review of its executive compensation practices in response, and Dudley said he expected that to yield changes. “I’m sure the board will modify this – there’s no question about it,” Dudley said. “You can’t be too short-term in how you reward executives, and I think the board is very clear on that.” Reporting by Caroline Stauffer, Luc Cohen and Juliana Castilla; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-argentina-bp-idUSKCN11K2I8,Commodities,Reuters
315,2017-08-10 00:00:00,2017,8.0,10,,Australia antitrust regulator raises flags on BP Woolworths petrol buyout,"(Reuters) - Australia’s antitrust regulator said on Thursday it was concerned BP Plc’s (BP.L) plan to buy the petrol stations of grocery giant Woolworths Ltd (WOW.AX) would hurt competition, a sign it may block the A$1.8 billion ($1.4 billion) deal. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said the buyout would cut the number of major rivals selling petrol, reducing the incentive to keep retail prices low. “As a result, motorists may end up paying more at the pump,” ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. Woolworths and London-based BP announced the deal in December 2016, a major component of the Australian retailer’s effort to cut non-core businesses and concentrate on a supermarket price war with rival Coles, owned by Wesfarmers (WES.AX). Woolworths issued a statement noting the regulator’s concerns and said it would “continue to work with BP and the ACCC to progress the merger clearance process”. The ACCC said Woolworths appears to influence fuel prices in large Australian cities, either by leading price cuts or quickly following competitors’ price cuts, and “we are concerned that BP would not follow Woolworths’s pricing strategy”. The regulator said it will publish a draft decision later this month, with a final decision scheduled for Oct. 26.

316,2016-05-17 00:00:00,2016,5.0,17,Dmitry Zhdannikov,Exclusive: BP exploration boss leaves after spending cuts,"LONDON (Reuters) - The head of exploration at BP (BP.L), Richard Herbert, is leaving the British oil major after slightly more than two years in the job, a period in which the company slashed spending on the search for new deposits. Herbert, a BP veteran and a long-time ally of chief executive Bob Dudley, rejoined BP in October 2013 after several years at rival Talisman Energy. His task was to lead exploration activity to help the firm rebuild investor confidence following a deadly U.S Gulf oil spill in 2010. But as oil prices began to crash from mid-2014 and BP had to shed assets to pay off some $50 billion in U.S. liabilities for the Macondo spill, the firm had to reduce funding for costly exploration projects. “Herbert simply didn’t get a chance to drill a lot of wells ... given where BP stood post-Macondo and where the oil price went,” a source close to the company said. Herbert was not immediately available to comment. In an emailed statement to Reuters, BP said Herbert would leave the company in June, following a decision to simplify the upstream executive team, headed by Bernard Looney, and bring exploration, global projects, reservoir developments and technology under one roof, reporting to James Dupree. Howard Leach, head of technical functions in exploration, has been appointed interim head of exploration. In the last two years, BP has found oil and gas in the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea, Egypt, Angola and Brazil, as well as establishing exploration positions in Russia, China and Mexico. But its reserves replacement ratio - a key metric for investors showing the extent to which new discoveries can replace annual output - fell to its lowest in many years in 2015 to 61 percent, from 63 percent in 2014 and 129 percent in 2013. Poor reserves replacement ratios are not only due to a lack of new deposits but also a lack of investment decisions amid low oil prices, since companies must commit to investing in new fields before they can book them as proven reserves. With oil prices down around 60 percent since mid-2014, the temptation among oil majors to cut exploration costs is strong but the nature of the energy business means companies must add new resources as producing assets gradually run out of oil. The reserve replacement picture varies greatly for BP’s rivals, with Shell showing even poorer numbers of 48 percent in the past three years while Eni had RRR of 148 percent in 2015. Like many of its rivals, BP was also badly burnt by some $3 billion in upstream write-offs, many due to unsuccessful exploration including in Libya, Angola and the Gulf of Mexico. Late last year, Herbert told a conference in Abu Dhabi that global deflation and lower prices of goods and services should help the company to be able to invest in long-term growth while cutting costs. But BP has, nevertheless, slashed its exploration spending to around $1 billion this year from $3.5 billion as recently as 2013 as it focused on rebalancing its finances to be able to keep paying dividend while also investing in existing fields. “(Exploration is) the one thing I think that we can phase, and we’ll just be very cautious and careful around that,” BP’s Chief Executive Bob Dudley said in February. Back in 2013, Herbert was brought in to replace another BP veteran, Mike Daly, who spent eight years as the head of exploration. Before joining Talisman, Herbert spent six years at TNK-BP in Russia as vice-president for exploration and then technology, serving under Dudley, who was then the chief executive of the venture between BP and several Russian-born oligarchs.

The existing deal is due to expire in 2024 and BP-led consortium and Azeri state oil firm SOCAR signed a letter of intent in December to continue developing the giant Azeri-Chirag-Guneshly (ACG) offshore fields until 2050. “End of June is a very reasonable time for it,” Gary Jones, BP’s regional head for Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, told reporters when asked when the contract was due to be signed. “It’s a big deal. We want to get it right.” The shareholders in the consortium include BP, SOCAR, Chevron, INPEX, Statoil, ExxonMobil, TPAO, ITOCHU and ONGC Videsh. Azeri President Ilham Aliyev said on Wednesday he expected the contract to be signed soon. “We are thinking about development of the ACG bloc and I think we will reach a final agreement with investors,” Aliyev said at the annual Caspian Oil & Gas conference in Baku. BP came under fire from Aliyev earlier this decade when the country’s leader criticised the oil firm for lower than promised output levels.

318,2017-05-02,2017,5.0,2,"Ron Bousso, Karolin Schaps",BP's profit triples on higher oil prices and output,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP’s profit nearly tripled in the first quarter of 2017 from a year earlier, buoyed by rising oil prices and production that hit a five-year high, while debt piled up in order to pay for acquisitions and costs for the 2010 Gulf of Mexico spill. The British oil and gas company joined oil major rivals including Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Total in posting stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings, mostly thanks to higher oil and gas prices. Oil prices rose by 50 percent in the past year to around $54 a barrel in the first quarter. BP expects prices to average between $50 and $55 a barrel in 2017, heading to the higher end of the range if OPEC and major producing countries extend production cuts into the second half of the year, Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary told Reuters. The results could assuage some concerns among investors, who were jolted when BP in February raised the oil price at which it could balance its books this year to $60 a barrel after a string of investments that pushed up borrowing. Three years since the oil prices slumped from above $100 a barrel and after BP slashed costs with lay-offs and project delays, investors want to see cash generation to cover spending and dividend payouts, while reducing ballooning debt. BP’s shares were trading 2.4 percent higher at 0721 GMT, the biggest winner on London’s bluechip FTSE 100 index. “The results are positive,” Cenkos Securities analysts wrote, but adding that “gearing is creeping up towards the max of the 20-30 percent target range, although divestments, including the recent $1.7 billion SECCO sale in China, should help.” Net debt rose 9 percent in the quarter to $38.6 billion, lifting BP’s gearing of net debt to shareholders’ equity from 26 percent to 28 percent, closer to its ceiling of 30 percent. “The debt was always going to rise in the first half of the year and the 28 percent gearing, frankly, that doesn’t cause any problems at all,” Gilvary said. To keep oil prices buoyant, oil companies want the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers to extend their global pact to reduce production for another six months from June 30. “If they don’t get rolled into the second half of the year we will continue to see more (price) volatility,” Gilvary said. London-based BP is set to start up seven projects this year, including in Oman and Azerbaijan, the largest number in a single year in BP’s history. It hopes to add 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) of new production by the end of the decade. The renewal of BP’s ADCO onshore oil concession in Abu Dhabi in December was a main contributor to BP’s first quarter rise in output. Total upstream production, excluding BP’s share of Rosneft output, reached a five-year high of 2.39 million bpd. Projects under construction are ahead of schedule and on average 15 percent below budget, BP said. BP’s operating cash flow in the quarter rose to $2.1 billion from $1.9 billion a year earlier, hit by payments made toward settling fines related to the 2010 deadly Deepwater Horizon rig explosion and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. BP took a pre-tax $161 million charge in the first quarter related to the spill. Total payments are expected to reach $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion this year. BP reported first-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, the company’s definition of net income, of $1.51 billion, exceeding analysts’ average forecast of $1.26 billion.

319,2016-06-02,2016,6.0,2,,"CORRECTED-Even for BP and Shell, North Sea remains a hard sell","(Corrects paragraph 29 to say that total UK North Sea decommissioning costs, not just for the 142 field mentioned, will reach 55 billion pounds) * High costs, decommissioning hamper deals * Shell not selling upstream assets at $48/bbl -CFO * BP fails to sell stake in Forties pipeline -sources * GRAPHIC-Assets on the market: tmsnrt.rs/1OehMq6 * GRAPHIC-Historic asset value: tmsnrt.rs/1SMFAqG By Ron Bousso LONDON, June 2 (Reuters) - When it comes to the North Sea, there is no such thing as an easy sale, even for oil giants Royal Dutch Shell and BP. More than any other region in the world, the North Sea has suffered greatly over the past two years as a 60 percent drop in oil prices, high operating costs, dwindling reserves and a tough tax regime has hit operators hard. As a result, producers ranging from Shell and France’s Total to smaller regional players such as Enquest and Tullow Oil have put dozens of assets in the region on the block to boost their balance sheets. But deals have been few and far apart. Buyers and sellers have found it hard to agree on the value of assets and how to share the costs of dismantling and cleaning up of obsolete fields, known as decommissioning. With around 30 percent of fields operating at a loss in 2016 and others seeing razor thin margins, “almost all UK North Sea assets are up for sale,” said Fiona Legate, senior UK upstream oil and gas analyst at consultancy WoodMackenzie. “There is however a limited pool of buyers,” she added. BP has struggled to sell a stake in its Forties pipeline system, one of the region’s oldest and the main source for the eponymous crude used to price the global Brent crude benchmark. Talks with Swiss-based chemical giant Ineos recently collapsed after the sides could not agree on how to price the asset, sources close to the negotiations said. The Forties pipeline has a capacity to deliver over 1 million barrels per day and serves over 50 offshore oil and gas fields in the central North Sea, according to BP’s website. But declining output has meant the pipeline operated at less than 40 percent of its capacity last year, WoodMackenzie says. Ineos wanted BP and other producers using the pipeline to commit to a fixed capacity fee that would guarantee revenue even if output continued to decline, industry sources close to the talks told Reuters. BP however sought to pay on a per-barrel basis, they said. “Buyers want something to protect them against a drop in throughput,” one source said. The pipeline system remains on the market. BP and Ineos declined to comment. The UK North Sea was a trailblazer for the unlocking of new oil and gas resources deep under the sea. But since hitting peak production in the late 1990s, it has been in steady decline. Shell is starting an ambitious three-year $30 billion global asset sale programme to pay for its $54 billion acquisition of smaller British rival BG Group in February. In the North Sea, the company is planning to bundle several assets in packages that will include mature fields along with more attractive assets such as the Buzzard field and pipelines, banking sources said. Bank of America Merrill Lynch will run the North Sea asset sales, banking sources said. The Anglo-Dutch company held talks in recent months with Neptune, a North Sea-focused investment company headed by former Centrica boss Sam Laidlow and backed by private equity funds Caryle Group and CVC Partners. Shell, Carlyle and Bank of America declined to comment. Shell Chief Financial Officer Simon Henry remains confident it can meet its target within around three years. Shell will focus at first on selling infrastructure, refining and retail businesses that are less exposed to oil price fluctuations over production, or upstream assets, he said. “If the oil price stays at $48 a barrel maybe (the sale programme) will take us a little bit longer. We are not chasing sales of upstream assets at $48.” Operating in the North Sea remains challenging even after Shell cut costs sharply in recent years, Henry said, adding that within the region, some areas are more profitable than others. “We’ve taken our costs down hugely and improved our reliability and availability. So the performance today is much better than it was two years ago but it is still not good,” Henry told reporters on May 24. “In general it is high cost region in which you have to keep spending to stay in business and have significant decommissioning and restoration costs.” An extended period of low oil prices also leads to an earlier decommissioning of fields, he said. WoodMackenzie estimates 142 fields will cease production over the next five years. Total UK North Sea decommissioning are expected to reach 55 billion pounds. “It is a vicious circle with the low oil price,” Henry said. M&A activity has not stopped completely and is focusing mostly on consolidating existing positions, Legate said. The recent recovery in oil prices to around $50 a barrel was nevertheless expected to revive M&A activity in the second half of the year, she added. BP last month doubled its interest in the Culzean gas field development to 32 percent after buying a stake from JX Nippon. Shell and Exxon Mobil last year sold a small cluster of fields, including the Anasuria Floating Production Storage and Offloading unit, to two Malaysian firms.

Mikal Watts was among five defendants found not guilty by a Mississippi federal jury of charges related to an alleged scheme to defraud a program set up by BP to compensate people who suffered economic losses from the spill. Two other defendants were found guilty. The U.S. Department of Justice had accused the defendants of submitting claims on behalf of more than 40,000 people who had not agreed to be represented by Watts’ firm, or else were identified with stolen or bogus Social Security numbers and other personal information. According to the indictment, one alleged victim, named Lucy Lu, who supposedly was a deckhand on a commercial seafood vessel, was actually a dog. The convicted defendants were Gregory Warren and Thi Houng “Kristy” Le, who prosecutors said helped collect names and information. Also acquitted were Watts’ brother David Watts and Wynter Lee, who both worked for Mikal Watts’ San Antonio law firm, and field representatives Hector Eloy Guerra and Thi Hoang “Abbie” Nguyen, who was Le’s sister-in-law. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Mikal Watts, who represented himself at trial, and lawyers for Warren and Le did not immediately respond to a request for comment. BP last month estimated it would incur $61.6 billion of overall liabilities for the April 20, 2010 spill, including for cleanup costs, damages claims and regulatory penalties. The case is U.S. v.

Kosmos, which has been listed in New York since 2011, announced a major gas find in partnership with BP off the coast of Senegal in May, boosting the area’s reputation as one of the world’s hotbeds for gas exploration. The company also owns parts of licenses to drill for oil offshore Suriname in South America close to where U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil and its partners recently decided to go ahead with a $4.4 billion oilfield megaproject. Kosmos expects its London listing to attract more European investors seeking exposure to promising oil and gas exploration. “There are a number of European investment funds and specialist international oil and gas investors that are currently unable to hold Kosmos’ shares due to their listing outside of a European regulated market,” the company said, explaining the rationale for its London secondary listing. The process is expected to complete later in the third quarter, it said. Kosmos estimates its licenses offshore Senegal and Mauritania could hold more than 50 trillion cubic feet of gas resources and it continues to drill further. “Kosmos offers exposure to an ongoing high-impact, three-well exploration campaign that could more than double its valuation – it is our favorite high-impact explorer,” said analysts at RBC Capital Markets who rate the stock as ‘outperform’.

BP’s second quarter contrasts with Total (TOTF.PA) and Norway’s Equinor (EQNR.OL), which posted sharp earnings drops, and builds on a steady recovery after deep cost cuts since the 2014 downturn, project start-ups and last year’s $10.5 billion purchase of BHP’s U.S. shale assets. “At the midpoint of our five-year plan, BP is right on target,” Chief Executive Bob Dudley said in a statement. By 0953 GMT, BP shares were up 3.1% to 543.5 pence, the top gainers in the FTSE 100 .FTSE index. (GRAPHIC - BP profits: tmsnrt.rs/2MqbBbG) Although BP’s dividend remained unchanged at 10.25 cents per share, its Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary said the company would consider raising it towards the end of the year as proceeds from asset sales come through and debt is reduced. BP’s results beat expectations for 10 quarters in a row, analysts at Bernstein said. “Strong volume growth from accretive barrels and seamless execution remains underappreciated,” said Bernstein, which has an “outperform” recommendation on the stock. Underlying replacement cost profit, the company’s definition of net income, reached $2.8 billion in the second quarter, exceeding a company-provided forecast of $2.46 billion. The second-quarter profit was up from $2.4 billion in the previous quarter, while BP’s operating cash flow recovered to $6.8 billion in the quarter from $5.3 billion in the previous quarter as a result of a one-off working capital release. Second-quarter production rose to 3.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, 4% higher than a year earlier. BP said it expects third-quarter 2019 reported production to be lower than second-quarter, reflecting maintenance activities as well as the impact of Hurricane Barry on operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Benchmark Brent crude oil prices in the second quarter averaged around $69 a barrel, up from $63 the previous quarter but down from $74 a barrel a year earlier, BP said. In the refining and marketing segment, known as downstream, profits dropped due to lower sales and refinery throughput as plants underwent maintenance ahead of a major change in marine fuel standards in 2020. Global growth in oil demand slowed in the first half of the year to around 1 million barrels per day but has slightly recovered in the second half, CFO Gilvary told Reuters. (GRAPHIC - BP Q2 cashflow: tmsnrt.rs/2yp7B2U) Despite the higher profit, BP’s debts rose in the first half of the year to $46.5 billion from $38.7 billion the previous year, mostly as a result of the BHP acquisition. Gearing, the ratio between debt and BP’s market value, rose to 31% compared with 27.5%. Shell (RDSa.L) reports results on Thursday, while Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Chevron (CVX.N) are scheduled for Friday. BP has not taken any of its oil tankers through the Strait of Hormuz since a July 10 attempt by Iran to seize one of its vessels, Gilvary said.

Retail services, such as convenience stores at petrol stations, have become a big revenue generator for oil majors such as BP and Royal Dutch Shell with profits often offsetting weakness in oil and gas production. BP operates a fuels and convenience business across 18 countries with more than 18,700 sites. Didi, China’s biggest ride-hailing company, runs a mobile transportation platform, offering users app-based options including car-sharing. Didi’s platform has 550 million users and more than 600,000 EVs run on it in China, BP said. The venture with BP will develop charging hubs for Didi’s drivers and the wider public and add convenience stores in the near future, BP said in a statement. The venture could build as many as 200 hubs with multiple charging points by the end of 2020, a BP spokesman said. BP believes the venture can be scaled up to thousands of hubs across China to reach a leading market position with unmanned and remotely controlled sites, separate from BP’s roughly 700 retail sites in the country, the spokesman added. “As the world’s largest EV market, China offers extraordinary opportunities,” BP quoted its downstream chief, Tufan Erginbilgic, as saying. “The lessons we learn here will help us further expand BP’s advanced mobility business worldwide, helping drive the energy transition and develop solutions for a low-carbon world.” China is the world’s largest EV market, with around 50% of battery electric vehicles globally. In January, BP said it would invest in Chinese start-up PowerShare, which links EV drivers to charging points and helps power suppliers balance distribution. With China targeting sales of more than 7 million EVs by 2025, the need to manage demand and distribution of power on the grid, particularly at times of peak demand, will be crucial. Corporate investors from outside the auto industry are betting on electric vehicles, vying with automakers and suppliers to bankroll companies working on everything from advanced batteries to charging devices and all-new EVs. In Europe, BP bought Britain’s top EV charging company Chargermaster last year, with the aim of linking the smaller firm’s services with BP petrol stations in the country.

In the first six months of the year, the company produced 13 million tonnes of oil in Azerbaijan, down from 15 million tonnes in the same period of 2018, and 0.9 billion cubic meters (bcm) of associated gas, down from 1.1 bcm a year earlier. A BP-led consortium said in a statement that it spent more than $272 million in operating expenditure and more than $657 million in capital expenditure on operations at the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) oilfields in the first half. The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline exported more than 120 million barrels (about 16 million tonnes) of crude oil loaded on 149 tankers at Ceyhan. The consortium said that its Azeri units produced around 8.4 billion standard cubic meters (bscm) of natural gas and around 2 million tonnes of condensate at the Shah Deniz field. The existing Shah Deniz facilities’ production capacity is currently more than 56 million standard cubic meters of gas per day. The consortium spent around $376 million in operating expenditure and $555 million in capital expenditure at Shah Deniz, the majority of which was associated with the Shah Deniz II project.

The oil and gas company has no current plans to take any of its own vessels through the strait, Gilvary said, adding that BP is shipping oil out of the region using chartered tankers. “We will continue to make shipments through there but you won’t see any BP-flagged tankers going through in the short term,” he said. Gilvary was speaking as the company reported better than expected second-quarter earnings due to a strong increase in oil and gas production. Tensions spiked between Iran and Britain this month when Iranian commandos seized a British-flagged tanker in the Strait of Hormuz, the world’s most important waterway for oil shipments. (Graphic: Strait of Hormuz - tmsnrt.rs/2NVdJKG) That came two weeks after British forces captured an Iranian oil tanker near Gibraltar suspected of violating European Union sanctions on Syria. Earlier this month, three Iranian vessels tried to block the passage of a BP-operated tanker through the Strait of Hormuz but withdrew after warnings from a British warship. Washington, which has by far the strongest Western naval contingent in the Gulf, on July 9 proposed stepping up efforts to safeguard the Strait of Hormuz.

334,2019-07-30,2019,7.0,30,Ron Bousso,"BP profit again outstrips forecasts, lifted by higher oil output","LONDON (Reuters) - A strong rise in oil and gas production helped BP (BP.L) offset weaker crude prices and refining profit to again beat profit expectations on Tuesday, boosting its shares. BP’s second quarter contrasts with Total (TOTF.PA) and Norway’s Equinor (EQNR.OL), which posted sharp earnings drops, and builds on a steady recovery after deep cost cuts since the 2014 downturn, project start-ups and last year’s $10.5 billion purchase of BHP’s U.S. shale assets. “At the midpoint of our five-year plan, BP is right on target,” Chief Executive Bob Dudley said in a statement. By 0953 GMT, BP shares were up 3.1% to 543.5 pence, the top gainers in the FTSE 100 .FTSE index. (GRAPHIC - BP profits: tmsnrt.rs/2MqbBbG) Although BP’s dividend remained unchanged at 10.25 cents per share, its Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary said the company would consider raising it towards the end of the year as proceeds from asset sales come through and debt is reduced. BP’s results beat expectations for 10 quarters in a row, analysts at Bernstein said. “Strong volume growth from accretive barrels and seamless execution remains underappreciated,” said Bernstein, which has an “outperform” recommendation on the stock. Underlying replacement cost profit, the company’s definition of net income, reached $2.8 billion in the second quarter, exceeding a company-provided forecast of $2.46 billion. The second-quarter profit was up from $2.4 billion in the previous quarter, while BP’s operating cash flow recovered to $6.8 billion in the quarter from $5.3 billion in the previous quarter as a result of a one-off working capital release. Second-quarter production rose to 3.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, 4% higher than a year earlier. BP said it expects third-quarter 2019 reported production to be lower than second-quarter, reflecting maintenance activities as well as the impact of Hurricane Barry on operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Benchmark Brent crude oil prices in the second quarter averaged around $69 a barrel, up from $63 the previous quarter but down from $74 a barrel a year earlier, BP said. In the refining and marketing segment, known as downstream, profits dropped due to lower sales and refinery throughput as plants underwent maintenance ahead of a major change in marine fuel standards in 2020. Global growth in oil demand slowed in the first half of the year to around 1 million barrels per day but has slightly recovered in the second half, CFO Gilvary told Reuters. (GRAPHIC - BP Q2 cashflow: tmsnrt.rs/2yp7B2U) Despite the higher profit, BP’s debts rose in the first half of the year to $46.5 billion from $38.7 billion the previous year, mostly as a result of the BHP acquisition. Gearing, the ratio between debt and BP’s market value, rose to 31% compared with 27.5%. Shell (RDSa.L) reports results on Thursday, while Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Chevron (CVX.N) are scheduled for Friday. BP has not taken any of its oil tankers through the Strait of Hormuz since a July 10 attempt by Iran to seize one of its vessels, Gilvary said. Gilvary added that the company had no plans to take any of its tankers through the world’s most important waterway for oil shipments, but was moving oil out of the region using chartered tankers.

335,2019-07-31,2019,7.0,31,Alison Frankel,Max Duncan lost $6 million investing in BP litigation. Now he’s blaming his ex-lawyers,"(Reuters) - Litigation finance is not for amateurs. If you don’t believe me, ask Max Duncan. The Texas businessman lost the nearly $6 million that he invested in a docket of claims against BP after the Deepwater Horizon spill. The money, as I’ll explain, evaporated into an allegedly fraudulent scheme to manufacture tens of thousands of plaintiffs. Then when Duncan and his litigation finance company, Duncan Litigation Investments, tried to recoup the lost millions by suing the plaintiffs’ firms that allegedly benefited from his investment, he ran into timeliness problems. In the latest development in the saga, DLI filed a complaint in Harris County Court in Texas, blaming Duncan’s own former lawyers at Baker Donelson Bearman Caldwell & Berkowitz for failing to procure a tolling agreement that would have extended the statute of limitations on Duncan’s claims against the plaintiffs’ firm that got him into this mess. Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast. No one connected with Duncan’s attempt to recoup his lost millions responded to my emails requesting comment. I reached out to his current lawyer, John Neese of Meade & Neese, and his former Baker Donelson lawyers Karen Smith and Joseph Crescenzo. Crescenzo was unavailable; Neese and Smith did not respond. I emailed Mikal Watts of Watts Guerra, who filed the fizzled BP claims funded by Duncan’s money, as well as Duncan’s erstwhile friend and Watts’ co-counsel Bob Hilliard of Hilliard Martinez Gonzales, and several of Hilliard’s defense lawyers at Beck Redden. They didn’t get back to me. This story comes from filings in Duncan’s litigation against the lawyers he blames for his $6 million fiasco. The tale begins, according to a 2018 complaint in Texas state court, with a co-counsel agreement between Hilliard and Watts, a pair of prominent personal injury lawyers who decided to team up to amass a docket of cases after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Hilliard allegedly approached Duncan, a family friend, to provide funding for the litigation onslaught he and Watts had mapped out. According to Duncan's suits against Hilliard and Watts, Hilliard led him to believe from the start that he and Watts had already signed up thousands of clients, whose claims would be handled by Watts’ firm. Duncan said that he and Hilliard entered an oral agreement in 2010 in which he provided Hilliard with $3.875 million to back the plaintiffs’ lawyers’ BP play. Hilliard, he alleged in his complaint, was supposed to figure out a structure that would allow Duncan to share in the attorneys’ fees that Hilliard would eventually be paid. If he couldn’t devise such a structure, Duncan alleged, Hilliard promised he’d repay Duncan’s $3.8 million investment. On Hilliard’s advice, Duncan alleges, he subsequently created Duncan Litigation Investments and entered into a written agreement with Hilliard. The deal called for DLI to invest up to $6 million to fund costs incurred by Hilliard and Watts in the BP case. In return, according to Duncan, DLI was to receive half of Hilliard’s fees. Duncan has claimed that both Watts and Hilliard assured him that he wouldn’t lose his money. The investment certainly seemed to yield quick results, according to Duncan. He alleged that he was originally told Watts had a docket of 15,000 cases against BP. Within a month or two of Duncan’s $3.8 million infusion of cash, the count was up to 25,000. Ultimately, the Watts firm would purport to represent 40,000 deckhands and seafood industry workers with claims against BP. As you probably recall, that number turned out to be a complete sham. In a 2011 email to Watts, Hilliard described their 40,000 clients as “ghosts in the wind.” Some were just names from the phonebook. Five were dead. One was a dog named Lucy. Federal prosecutors indicted Watts and six codefendants – including two investigators who had run the field operation to sign up BP clients – for fabricating claims. Watts countered that he and his employees at Watts Guerra were not aware that their contractors were fabricating clients. He contended that prosecutors had cherry-picked emails to make it seem as though he knew trouble was afoot when, in fact, he was duped by the field investigators he'd hired. Watts and his law firm colleagues were acquitted after a trial. The field investigators were convicted. Duncan claimed in his litigation against Watts and Hilliard that the lawyers misled him about the prospects of their BP cases even as their docket evaporated. Toward the end of 2010, Duncan alleged, Watts talked him out of selling his stake in the BP cases, even though BP’s claims facility was already challenging the documentation of Watts’ purported clients. “I said, ‘Should I sell out?’” Duncan recounted at a deposition. “And (Watts) said, ‘If I were you, I definitely would not do that. This is going to turn out just fine.’” The Watts firm was able to show that Duncan was included in email traffic in which the plaintiffs’ firms discussed burgeoning problems with their docket and strategized about how to wrest a settlement from BP before the company figured out what was going on. By the time of Duncan’s last contribution to the BP litigation – $100,000 in July 2012 – Duncan had been on email chains talking about dead “clients,” “ghosts,” and BP’s assertion that there were only 5,000 deckhands working in the Gulf of Mexico at the time of the oil spill, a fraction of the 40,000 clients that Watts claimed to represent. Duncan's litigation against Watts ended with a whimper. In April 2018, Judge Bobby Galvan of Nueces County District Court in Texas granted Watts Guerra’s motion for summary judgment against Duncan Litigation Investments, holding that Duncan had waited too long to sue. Last month, a three-judge appellate panel in Corpus Christi affirmed the judgment. By March 2011, the appeals court found, DLI was on notice that “43 people had claimed Watts Guerra used their social security number without authorization; there were nowhere near 40,000 Vietnamese deckhands in the Gulf at the time of the oil spill; a percentage of their clients were nothing more than ‘names in a phonebook’ and duplications; and Watts Guerra had filed a claim on behalf of someone who had been dead for five years.” Even though DLI alleged that it subsequently learned additional damning information, including an old arrest record for one of Watts Guerra’s investigators, the appeals court said that Duncan knew or should have known by early 2011 that fraud had tainted the BP docket. His 2016 negligence suit against Watts and Watts’ firm, the court held, was years too late. Duncan and DLI sued Hilliard in February 2018. (Technically, DLI asserted its case as a cross-petition in an identity theft suit brought by purported Watts Guerra clients.) The complaint alleged that Hilliard had induced Duncan to invest in a fraudulent scheme that caused him to suffer “at least $6.35 million in economic losses and seven years of humiliation and mental anguish,” including the cost of criminal defense lawyers Duncan had to hire in connection with the government’s investigation of the sham BP docket. Among Duncan’s allegations: Hilliard had promised many times to make him whole by repaying the $6 million but never came through. In May 2018, Harris County District Judge Jeff Shadwick ordered Duncan’s case against Hilliard to arbitration. So what happened? I believe that Duncan’s new complaint against Baker Donelson reveals the outcome of his dispute with Hilliard. To be sure, the complaint does not include Hilliard’s name or the name of his firm. The suit refers only to an unnamed plaintiffs’ lawyer and firm that entered a contract with DLI in 2010 and was sued by Duncan and DLI in February 2018. The complaint also alleges that DLI’s suit against the unnamed plaintiffs’ firm, which included claims under the Texas Securities Act, ended up in arbitration. All of those facts suggest the unnamed firm is Hilliard’s shop. Duncan’s complaint describes a pyrrhic victory against the plaintiffs’ firm. According to his new complaint, three arbitrators ruled earlier this month that the evidence supports DLI’s claim to rescissory and consequential damages and attorneys’ fees – to the tune of between $9.2 million and $47.9 million. Unfortunately for Duncan, the arbitrators also found that DLI’s claims are time-barred. So instead of nearly $50 million in damages and fees, he’s owed nothing from the plaintiffs’ firm that allegedly induced him to sink $6 million into phony BP claims. Duncan’s latest play is to tag Baker Donelson, which began representing him in 2013 and worked on DLI’s cases against Watts and Hilliard, with blame for the mess, asserting that although the firm obtained a tolling agreement between Duncan and the unnamed plaintiffs’ firm, it failed to toll the statute of limitations on claims by Duncan’s investment vehicle, DLI. The complaint quotes the arbitration panel: “The panel members are at a loss to understand why DLI was never included in any of the tolling agreements, particularly given that it must have been clear to DLI/Duncan’s counsel that DLI was the owner of these important potential claims.” In the new suit, Duncan seeks at least $1 million.

337,2016-02-02,2016,2.0,2,"Karolin Schaps, Ron Bousso",BP reports biggest ever annual loss,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP (BP.L) slumped to its biggest annual loss last year and announced thousands more job cuts on Tuesday, showing that even one of the nimblest oil producers is struggling in the worst market downturn in over a decade. The British oil and gas company, which is still grappling with about $55 billion of costs from the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, said it would cut 7,000 jobs by the end of 2017, or nearly 9 percent of its workforce. BP said it lost $6.5 billion in 2015 and its fourth-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, which is the company’s definition of net income, came in at $196 million, well below analyst expectations of $730 million. BP shares fell as much as 8.5 percent and were 8.1 percent lower at 6.36 a.m ET, the worst performer on the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 and on track for their biggest one-day fall since June 2010. The company’s 2015 loss shows that even its “shrink to grow” strategy adopted after the Macondo rig explosion in 2010, hailed as the best preparation for a weak oil market, was unable to buffer the impact of the lowest oil prices since 2003. “Should low oil prices prevail, they’re a quarter or two away from having to cut the dividend, or divest some more assets,” said Jack Allardyce, analyst at Cenkos Securities. Dividends are considered sacrosanct among most major oil companies but BP’s weak results and outlook are likely to put pressure on a company that has had to increase borrowing. BP maintained its 2015 dividend at 10 cents per share. BP’s results are the latest to show the extent large oil companies are struggling following a 70 percent slide in oil prices since the middle of 2014 that has forced them to cut tens of thousands of jobs and slash spending. BP’s 2015 annual loss was bigger than the overall loss of $4.9 billion it reported in 2010, even though it took a $17.2 billion hit in the second quarter of that year after the explosion in the Gulf of Mexico. BP declined to comment when asked if the company’s 2015 loss was the biggest on record. Chevron (CVX.N), the second biggest U.S. producer behind Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), reported its first quarterly loss last week in more than 13 years. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) is expected to report a near halving of profits. BP’s poor results came a day after credit ratings agency Standard and Poor’s placed the company on the path toward a credit downgrade and lowered Shell’s rating. BP took a bigger-than-expected hit at its upstream oil and gas production business and booked charges of $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter because of low oil prices, including on fields in the Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. Utica shale acreage in Ohio and Libya. Analysts at Bernstein said warmer than expected weather in 2015 probably meant that BP took a hit from some of its oil and gas hedging positions. Benchmark Brent oil prices averaged $43 a barrel in the fourth quarter of 2015, down from $76 a year earlier. The poor market backdrop is set to persist with Brent averaging about $33 per barrel in 2016 so far. BP said if the current downturn persists for longer than anticipated, it would be able to reduce its costs further to allow its balance sheet to break even below $60 a barrel. “Should current conditions persist for longer than anticipated, we expect that all the actions we are taking will capture more deflation,” Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary said in a statement. The oil and gas sector is set to slash spending to its lowest in six years in 2016 to $522 billion, following a 22 percent fall to $595 billion in 2015, according to analysts. It would be the first time since 1986 that the industry has cut spending for two consecutive years. BP said its capital spending came to $18.7 billion in 2015, down from a planned $24-$26 billion, and it expected 2016 spending to be at the lower end of a $17-19 billion range. BP reduced operating costs by $3.5 billion last year and said it expected savings to reach $7 billion by 2017. It plans to cut 3,000 jobs in its downstream division by the end of 2017, on top of 4,000 cuts in its oil and gas production business announced last year. “We are continuing to move rapidly to adapt and rebalance BP for the changing environment,” Chief Executive Bob Dudley said in a statement. Despite lower revenue from oil production, BP’s output rose 5.4 percent to 2.26 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Its refining and trading operations, benefiting from cheap fuel prices, once again offset losses in oil and gas production, although BP indicated that supply and trading weakened over the fourth quarter compared to a year earlier. Like many of its peers, BP has tapped the debt market to plug the gap in income to cover spending and dividend payouts. BP said it intends to maintain its debt at current levels. Its debt-to-equity ratio stood at 21.6 percent at the end of 2015. Editing by Jason Neely and David Clarke",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bp-results-idUSKCN0VB0JB,Business News,Reuters

BP, one of three partners with Norway’s Statoil and Algeria’s Sonatrach in the In Amenas joint venture plant, said it understood proceedings against certain BP entities had been issued in the London court. “BP remains deeply saddened by the tragic events at In Amenas ... It is the terrorists who are responsible for the deaths and injuries that occurred because of the attack,” a spokesman said. The Islamist militants’ attack on the plant in January 2013 killed 40 people, most of them foreign nationals. “Our clients have now commenced court proceedings to help them secure the justice they seek following the deaths of Carlos and Sebastian,” said Clive Garner, leading the case at law firm Irwin Mitchell on behalf of the families of BP employees Carlos Estrada Valencia, 44, and Sebastian John, 26, who were both killed during the attack. In February last year an inquest criticised BP and its joint venture partners over security at the plant, where armed guards meant to protect the facility were stationed 1 kilometre away from the site and the entrance gates to the accommodation compound were found to have been left open. BP said several of its entities are facing similar civil claims in the Texas state court that were brought by individuals injured in the incident and some families of workers killed. The London court case was filed last week and a trial could be more than a year away, a spokesman for Irwin Mitchell said.

Offers for the 50 percent stake, the British oil and gas company’s largest investment in China, will be submitted in the coming days, the sources said. SK Chemicals Co Ltd, a pharmaceutical unit of South Korea’s SK Group; Austrian plastics group Borealis, owned by Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund IPIC and oil and gas company OMV; and privately-owned Switzerland-based chemicals company Ineos [INGRP.UL] are set to bid for the asset, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the information isn’t public. At least one other company is considering entering the bidding round. BP’s partner in the joint venture, state-owned China Petroleum & Chemical Corp (Sinopec), has a right of first refusal. It has said it is discussing the conditions put forward by BP, but has made no decision. BP and the three potential bidders declined to comment or were not immediately available to comment. SECCO, a venture formed in 2001, produces ethylene and propylene, which are used to make resins, plastics and synthetic rubbers. BP, like other of the world’s top oil companies, is in the midst of a divestment drive in order to focus its business and boost cash flow in the wake of the halving of oil prices since mid-2014. It is planning sales worth $3-$5 billion this year. The company has sold more than $50 billion of assets since a deadly explosion on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. BP has sold several assets to Ineos in recent years, including the Grangemouth refinery in Scotland as part of a $9 billion sale of the olefins and refining business Innovene in 2005.

342,2016-12-13,2016,12.0,13,,Slack management exposed BP to high safety risk -leaked report,"* ‘Inadequate management’ cause of 75 incidents reviewed * BP trails other rivals in safety risk mitigation * 2015 internal report says ‘highly material safety risks’ remain By Ron Bousso LONDON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - BP’s refining operations are exposed to high safety risks that can lead to deadly accidents and pollution as a result of slack management and a lack of investment, according to a leaked internal report from 2015. The report, co-authored by BP, IBM and industry consultancy WorleyParsons, states that the British company’s refining and petrochemical business, known as downstream, is trailing rivals such as Royal Dutch Shell by up to seven years in managing information to reduce safety risks and financial losses. “Inadequate management and use of engineering information has been a root cause or contributing factor” in 15 percent of 500 high-risk incidents reviewed in the report, which was provided by Greenpeace. BP has strived to improve its safety record since the 2010 Deepwater Horizon rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico where 11 people were killed and which led to the largest environmental disaster in U.S. history. In comments on the leaked report, BP said it was “committed to safe, reliable and compliant operations. With that in mind, BP regularly conducts internal assessments in an effort to make improvements to its operations”. “This particular report focused on potential enhancements to how BP manages engineering data. It is not an analysis of any operational incidents, and any suggestion that this report indicates BP is wavering from its safety commitment is wrong,” a company spokesman said. The most significant incident recorded by the authors occurred in January 2014 at the 413,500 barrels per day (bpd) Whiting, Indiana refinery which cost BP $258 million in lost production. The incident at the gasoil hydrotreater unit, which removes sulphur from oil, was due to “multiple deficiencies in engineering information management”. At the Hull petrochemical plant in northern England equipment that was not operated correctly led to losses of $35 million to $45 million. BP’s safety record came in to focus in 2005 when a blast at its Texas City refinery killed 15 workers and injured 180 others. BP was fined $84.6 million by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration between 2005 and 2012 for safety rules violations found at the refinery in investigations following the blast. The report said highly material safety risk and financial performance issues remained due to “the lack of refining and petrochemicals-wide direction, governance, coordination and investment”. The upstream segment, which produces oil and gas, has further work to do but is however significantly ahead of downstream, the report said, reflecting the big focus BP has placed on safety after the Deepwater Horizon explosion. Greenpeace UK’s senior climate adviser Charlie Kronick said in a statement that “BP’s sloppy approach to a crucial aspect of safety hasn’t changed”. “The same happy-go-lucky attitude that played a role in major accidents in the past is seemingly still reflected in the management of safety information across the oil giant’s operations from rig to refinery.” (Reporting by Ron Bousso; editing by Susan Thomas)",http://www.reuters.com/article/bp-safety-idUSL5N1E84OX,Market News,Reuters

344,2017-11-15,2017,11.0,15,,BP begins share buybacks as years of austerity pay off,"(Reuters) - BP Plc (BP.L) said on Wednesday it would begin a share buyback program, making it the first major European energy company to resume buybacks since the 2014 price slump in a sign years of austerity have paid off. The British oil company, which recently reported a doubling in third-quarter profit, said the buyback program had been authorized for between Nov. 15 and the date of its 2018 annual general meeting, with the maximum number of shares not exceeding 1.96 billion. BP first announced the buyback on Oct. 31, as it gradually shakes off the impact of the deadly 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill, known as Macondo, that cost it over $63 billion in clean-up costs and penalties. BP said then it would buy back the equivalent number of shares it was issuing as part of its scrip dividend scheme through which investors can opt to receive dividend payouts in shares rather than cash. It will buy back around $1.6 billion worth of shares a year in order to offset the dilutive effect of the scrip dividend program, BP Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary said then. Europe’s other top oil and gas companies are making other moves to woo shareholders. Norway’s Statoil STL.OL has said it will stop offering a scrip dividend in the fourth quarter, while France’s Total (TOTF.PA) plans to do so next year. BP's shares, which had risen to their highest in over three years on news of the resumption of buybacks, were down 0.9 percent at 498.6 pence at 0908 GMT, broadly in line with London's blue-chip index .FTSE.

345,2016-04-14,2016,4.0,14,"Ron Bousso, Karolin Schaps","BP investors say ""no"" to CEO Dudley's $20 million pay deal","LONDON (Reuters) - BP’s shareholders have voted against Chief Executive Bob Dudley’s $20 million pay deal for 2015, a rare investor revolt for such a major company, after it recorded a record annual loss. Some 59 percent of shareholders on Thursday opposed the pay and benefits package, according to preliminary figures, in stark contrast with previous years when over 80 percent and sometimes as many as 90 percent voted in favor of the pay packages for senior executives. Investors gathered at the ExCel exhibition center in east London gasped when the initial voting figures were displayed on screen in the hall during the company’s annual meeting. BP’s stock was down 1.3 percent at 1450 GMT, underperforming most rivals and the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares. Dudley’s 2015 pay and benefits rose 20 percent even though the company cut 5,000 jobs last year and reported steep losses after oil prices plunged. While rival Royal Dutch Shell stayed in the black last year, its chief executive, Ben van Beurden, saw his pay fall to 5.6 million euros ($6.3 million) from 24.2 million euros. Even though the vote was non-binding, BP executives said they would consider making changes to the way remuneration is calculated in future. “We will ... review the overall remuneration package,” Ann Dowling, head of BP’s remuneration committee, told shareholders at the meeting. “I will report on this next year with our conclusions and with a new proposed policy based on the outcome of this review.” The review will include assessing how the remuneration committee deals with oil price fluctuations and will engage directly with major shareholders. BP had long argued that management rewards should be based on a combination of factors including cash generation and operational performance. Last year Dudley clinched a final settlement with U.S. authorities over the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil disaster, which many investors said removed uncertainty around the firm’s future but also led to a big provision, pushing the company into the red. Britain’s biggest mutual life and pensions fund, Royal London Asset Management, and two shareholder advisers, Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, had all recommended rejecting Dudley’s pay. “The 59.1 percent vote against the executive directors remuneration is extraordinary and shows a lack of discretion by BP’s board,” said Ashley Hamilton Claxton, corporate governance manager at Royal London. Top 10 investor Legal & General Investment Management said it voted against the remuneration package as the company “should have used discretion to scale back bonus payments and long-term incentive awards to executive directors” during the year. “We welcome the Chairman’s speech to meet leading investors and we will continue to engage with BP to develop a policy better aligned to long term shareholder returns,” LGIM said in a statement. BP said last month that executive directors received no increase in base salary in 2015 and that the senior leadership would not see salary increases this year either. However, Dudley’s total pay was boosted by a payment to his U.S. pension scheme and deferred bonus payments. The shareholder vote is rare but not unprecedented. In 2012 a majority of shareholders at two British companies, WPP and Aviva, voted against proposed pay deals for executives in what the media become known as the “Shareholder Spring”. Aviva Chief Executive Andrew Moss left the insurer a few days later, but WPP’s long-serving CEO Martin Sorrell is still at the helm of the advertising group. In Germany Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) top management board has agreed to cut executives’ bonus payments by at least 30 percent, a source said this week, as the troubled carmaker struggles to resolve a dispute over management pay in the wake of the emissions scandal.. BP had earlier struck a cautious tone on dividend payments, one of the main attractions for investors in energy firms but harder to justify in an era of lower commodity prices. BP told investors it aimed to maintain dividends but could review the payout policy if oil prices remained lower for longer. BP, which had long said dividends were an absolute priority, said that although its goal was to maintain dividends, it “must” at the same time secure its future by investing wisely. “Be assured that we keep this balance under regular review. Should the oil price remain lower, longer than expected, we will need to revisit our financial framework,” BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said. Last year Italy’s ENI was the first major oil company to cut dividends.

350,2016-04-26,2016,4.0,26,"Ron Bousso, Karolin Schaps",BP eyes more spending cuts after 80 percent profit drop,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP said on Tuesday it could cut capital spending further after reporting an 80 percent drop in profits in the first quarter of the year, when oil prices touched a near 13-year low. The British oil company, the first major to report on one of the weakest quarters, lowered its 2016 spending target to $17 billion, from $17-19 billion, and said the marker could fall to $15-$17 billion next year if oil prices remain weak. These cost reductions have enabled the oil producer to forecast it can balance its books at an oil price of $50-55 a barrel in 2017, it said, down from $60 previously eyed. BP shares opened 3 percent higher on the London Stock Exchange on Tuesday, the second-biggest gainer in the blue-chip FTSE 100 index. Chief Executive Bob Dudley said he expected crude prices to recover towards the end of the year as producers halt work on fields and fuel demand remains robust. “Market fundamentals continue to suggest that the combination of robust demand and weak supply growth will move global oil markets closer into balance by the end of the year,” Dudley said. The BP CEO suffered an embarrassing shareholder revolt earlier this month when investors rejected his $20 million remuneration package. Faced with the worst downturn in the oil sector in at least three decades, BP reduced its capital spending three times in 2015 to $19 billion, slashed nearly 10 percent of its workforce of about 80,000 and sharply lowered costs. BP slipped to its biggest annual loss last year as a result of lower oil prices, costs related to the settlement of a deadly 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill and huge writedowns. BP’s first-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, its definition of net income, was $532 million, down from $2.6 billion a year earlier but beating forecasts for a loss of $140 million, according to consensus figures provided by BP. It said 2017 cash costs will be $7 billion lower than for 2014. BP’s current total charge for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill has risen to $56.4 billion after an additional payment of $917 million in the first quarter outside a settlement reached last year, it added. BP is the first oil major to reveal the financial impact of record-low oil prices in the first quarter, closely followed by peers Total, Statoil and Eni later this week and Shell on May 4. BP’s refining and trading segment, known as downstream, once again came to the rescue with a quarterly profit of $1.8 billion, offsetting a $747 million loss in oil and gas production.

351,2019-04-24,2019,4.0,24,Ron Bousso,Shell in talks to buy BP stake in North Sea gas field: sources,"LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell is in talks to buy BP’s stake in the Shearwater oil and gas field in the British North Sea for around $250 million, three industry sources told Reuters. Shell, the field’s operator, announced plans last year to expand a gas hub around Shearwater, including the construction of a new pipeline. Shell has a 28 percent stake in Shearwater, BP holds 27.5 percent and Exxon Mobil has the remaining 44.5 percent. For BP, a sale would mark a step toward its target of selling $5 to $6 billion of assets following its $10.5 billion purchase of BHP’s shale oil and gas portfolio in the United States last year. Shell and BP, which both declined to comment, have held talks in recent weeks and are close to an agreement although the deal could still fall through, two of the sources said. Both Shell and BP have sold a large number of assets in the aging North Sea basin in recent years. But at the same time they are investing heavily in new projects in the region, particularly in the West of Shetlands area, as technology and cost cuts open new opportunities that were once considered too expensive. Shearwater, located 225 kilometres (140 miles) east of Aberdeen, was discovered in 1988 and first developed in 2000. At peak production, the gas export capacity of the Shearwater hub is expected to be around 400 million standard cubic feet of gas a day, or roughly 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, according to Shell. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ NORTH SEA MAP (SOURCE: BP WEBSITE) tmsnrt.rs/2W3eiBT ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> Reporting by Ron Bousso; Editing by Alexander Smith",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bp-northsea-shell/shell-in-talks-to-buy-bp-stake-in-north-sea-gas-field-sources-idUSKCN1S015O,Deals,Reuters

In May the British Museum was forced to temporarily close after Greenpeace activists climbed its facade, demonstrating against BP’s sponsorship of a new exhibition about ancient Egypt, one of several protests at cultural events against its extraction of fossil fuels. The oil major said on Thursday it will pay around 7.5 million pounds ($10 million) over five years from 2018 for sponsorship of events such as the open air Big Screen showings of performances from the Royal Opera House in London’s Covent Garden and its annual Portait Award. BP decided earlier this year to cancel its near 30-year sponsporship deal with the Tate Britain art museum, saying it had to save money. That deal will not be renewed. The London-based oil producer wants to save $7 billion in costs by 2017 as it grapples with lower revenue due to a sharp drop in oil prices. “Our industry is going through a period of rebalancing, but our commitment to the UK and to our partners is for the long-term,” said Peter Mather, the head of BP’s British business.

ANS is mostly transported to the U.S. West Coast on U.S.-flagged vessels owned by BP, ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil. Two shipments have left U.S. ports this year for destinations in Japan and Nicaragua, but ANS exports remain rare because of the high shipping costs from Alaska. BP spokeswoman Dawn Patience said in an email that the company had chartered Tianlong Spirit, a Bahamas-flagged Suezmax vessel, for commercial and operational reasons. She declined to specify the destination for the crude and said the vessel would sail after BP receives approvals from the state of Alaska and the U.S. Coast Guard. Two trade sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the cargo would sail to Asia.

The company already has over 100 retail outlets in Mexico, many operated by distributors that previously worked for Mexico’s state-owned oil company Pemex. Energy reforms ended Pemex’s nearly 80-year monopoly several years ago and opened Mexico’s gasoline stations to international investment from the likes of Exxon Mobil Corp, Valero Energy Corp and Andeavor. Trading firm Glencore announced plans last year to start importing fuel for Mexico’s domestic market. “We are looking at all different kinds of operations there,” Rick Altizer, BP senior vice president of sales and marketing said on Wednesday. He said they are open to waterfront terminals, rail operations or other logistical assets to supply its stations. BP is also in the process of opening 10 stores in the U.S. Northeast under the Amoco brand, which it had previously retired. The Amoco label allows BP to expand in areas already saturated with BP stations, and appeals to customer nostalgia for the older label, Altizer said, speaking at an Amoco station in Pelham, New York. The label will also be used in other parts of the country. The company expects global demand growth of 2.4 percent this year and 1.7 percent in 2019 even as automotive efficiency improves, he said.

356,2017-02-07,2017,2.0,7,"Karolin Schaps, Ron Bousso",BP lifts break-even oil price after profit miss,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP (BP.L) raised the oil price at which it can balance its books this year to $60 a barrel on Tuesday due to higher spending following a string of investments as annual earnings fell for a second consecutive year. After the average oil price fell to its lowest in 12 years at $44 a barrel last year, BP said it expected prices to have found a floor for this year at $50 a barrel following a decision by major OPEC and non-OPEC producers to limit output. The British oil and gas company, whose fourth quarter profits fell short of street expectations, had previously targeted a breakeven oil price of $50-55 a barrel. The new target reflects an uptick in planned spending to $16-17 billion from $16 billion in 2016. BP’s annual underlying replacement cost, its definition of net profit, slumped to its lowest level in at least a decade to $2.59 billion, while fourth-quarter profit of $400 million missed analysts’ forecasts by around 30 percent primarily due to $328 million in one-off charges. It is the latest oil major to miss forecasts following worse-than-expected results from Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), Chevron (CVX.N) and Statoil STL.OL. BP shares were down 2.9 percent at 0851 GMT at 462.5 pence, underperforming the sector index .SXEP which was 0.6 percent lower. “BP are not covering their dividend and they raised their cash breakeven point quite considerably,” said Macquarie equities analyst Iain Reid. “They are having to pay for what they bought and they are the only company that actually raised their breakeven number,” he said. BP has been on a spending spree in recent months, concluding a string of deals, including in Eni’s (ENI.MI) giant Zohr offshore gas field in Egypt, contracts in Abu Dhabi and Azerbaijan and a stake in exploration areas off Mauritania and Senegal from Kosmos (KOS.N). The burst in activity marks a return to growth for the company whose deadly 2010 Deepwater Horizon rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico forced it to sell assets worth billions of dollars. But this growth also means higher costs. BP’s production is expected to rise this year as it is set to start up eight projects, including in Oman and Azerbaijan, the largest number in the company’s history in a single year. The company hopes to add 800,000 barrels per day of new production by the end of the decade. Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary told Reuters that a decision by oil-producing nations to cut output in order to prop up prices would have only limited impact on BP’s production through its recently renewed Abu Dhabi concession. “If everything holds in terms of what OPEC has said I think we will hold north of $50 a barrel,” Gilvary told Reuters. BP reported an annual loss of $542 million in its oil and gas production division, known as upstream, while profits for the refining and trading division were down 25 percent at $5.6 billion. BP’s bill to compensate for damages caused by the explosion and ensuing oil spill have risen to $62.6 billion.

357,2016-12-19,2016,12.0,19,,"BP splashes out on deals to beef up oil, gas reserves","LONDON (Reuters) - BP (BP.L) on Monday agreed to buy stakes in gas-heavy exploration areas off the coast of Mauritania and Senegal from Kosmos (KOS.N), days after announcing the long-awaited renewal of an onshore oil concession in Abu Dhabi. The combined deals are worth around $3.4 billion and will add valuable oil and gas reserves to BP’s books that have seen resources shrink on the back of divestments it needed to make to pay for the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. They follow BP’s purchase of a stake in Eni’s giant Zohr gas field offshore Egypt for $375 million last month and come at a time of rising oil prices. BP said on Monday it had agreed to buy a 62 percent stake and operational control of Kosmos’ Mauritania exploration blocks, which include the Tortue discovery, estimated by Kosmos to contain more than 15 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas. In comparison, Eni’s Zohr field, the largest discovery ever made in the Mediterranean, is estimated to contain 30 tcf. Gas from the Tortue field is set to be exported from a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility, giving BP an opportunity to grow in a highly competitive sector in which rival Shell (RDSa.L) took the lead earlier this year with the $54 billion acquisition of BG Group. BP also agreed to buy a 32.5 percent stake in Kosmos’ Senegal blocks, spending in total around $1 billion on the Kosmos deal. Kosmos is a Dallas-based energy company. “We believe the basin will become an important profit center for our upstream business,” said Bernard Looney, chief executive of BP’s upstream business. On Saturday, BP closed the renewal of a 40-year-long participation in the Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Petroleum Operations (ADCO) after two years of negotiations, taking a 10 percent stake in return for a roughly 2 percent share in BP. The concessions included in the deal have total resources of 20-30 billion barrels of oil equivalent. “BP’s shopping spree is the company’s response to what the investor community has long been concerned about: long-term growth and resource sustenance,” said Brendan Warn, analyst at BMO Capital Markets, who has an “Outperform” rating on the stock. “BP’s timing might have also been triggered by what it sees as a likely recovery in the oil price and asset values over 2017.” Oil prices have climbed above $50 a barrel in recent weeks as the world’s biggest oil producers have agreed to reduce output to stem global oversupply. Shares in BP were up 0.6 percent at 1027 GMT, outperforming the oil and gas companies index .SXEP, which was down 0.15 percent.

358,2018-05-22,2018,5.0,22,,BP to cut 3 percent of upstream jobs by year-end,"(Reuters) - British oil giant BP Plc said it plans to cut 3 percent of jobs in exploration and production, as part of a restructuring of its global upstream business to make the division more efficient and competitive. A BP spokesman said the cuts of around 540 jobs from the company’s 18,000-strong total upstream workforce will be carried out by the end of the year. The move is part of an ongoing process to simplify the company’s structure and increase efficiency, following the $50 billion worth of divestments over recent years, BP said in a statement. It did not comment on any possible cost savings associated with the redundancies. BP held out the prospect of a first dividend increase since 2014, after first-quarter profits beat forecasts earlier this month, thanks to rising oil and gas prices and production. The 110-year old company is undergoing its fastest growth in recent history with new oil and gas fields from Egypt and Oman to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, riding a tide of higher oil prices following the 2014 downturn. BP remains committed to developing its upstream opportunities and delivering its existing five-year growth strategy, the company said in an emailed response on Tuesday. Shares of the company were down 1 percent at 1410 GMT.

359,2019-06-05,2019,6.0,5,,Senegal president says truth of BP gas deal will be established,"DAKAR (Reuters) - Senegalese President Macky Sall said on Wednesday the government would find out the truth after a report alleged his brother Aliou Sall had been involved in fraud related to two major offshore gas blocks operated by BP. Making his first comments since the BBC published its report on Monday, the president defended his record in developing the nation’s energy industry but stopped short of calling for a formal investigation, which the opposition have demanded. “I want the truth to be re-established and the government will do this now without delay,” he said after attending prayers for the Eid-al-Fitr Muslim holiday at Dakar’s main mosque. In a statement later on Wednesday, the government rejected the BBC report as one-sided, describing it as “punctuated with serious and false allegations.” “The Senegalese government reserves the right to follow up on this issue as appropriate,” it said. The BBC report alleged that, in a previously unpublished arrangement, BP had agreed to pay Timis Corporation, a firm run by Romanian-Australian tycoon Frank Timis, about $10 billion in royalty payments for its stake in the two blocks. The BBC said that, based on documents it had reviewed, a secret payment of $250,000 was made by Timis to a company run by the president’s brother. The report casts a shadow over Senegal’s energy plans before the first oil and gas starts flowing and despite reassurances from the president that he would root out corruption. Aliou Sall has denied receiving the payment and called the BBC’s report “totally false”. Timis has not been reachable for comment, but told the BBC in a statement that there had been “no wrongdoing whatsoever”. The blocks are currently operated by BP, which has said it “rejects any implication that it acted improperly in the acquisition of our interests in Senegal.” Senegal’s offshore oil and gas reserves have the potential to transform the poor West African country when they start flowing in the next decade, with volumes expected to rival some of the region’s biggest producer. The blocks, called Cayar Offshore Profond and St. Louis Profond, have caused controversy since 2012, when a previously unknown company called Petro-Tim was unexpectedly awarded the licence despite having no known track record in the industry. Soon after, the president’s brother was hired at the company. Protests against the deal erupted in the capital Dakar in 2016 during Sall’s first term. Responding to the president’s remarks on Wednesday, opposition leader Ousmane Sonko said citizens should demonstrate again. “I call on Senegalese men and women, especially the sacrificed and forgotten youth, to mobilise massively and non-stop in the coming days in protest against all the scandals ... until appropriate measures are taken,” he said in a statement.

The energy traders, together with Austria’s Wien Energie, had previously tested BTL’s Interbit blockchain platform over 12 weeks, carrying out trades in European natural gas. For example, the blockchain system found a discrepancy in the volume allocation of a trade of French gas sold by Eni to BP, eradicating a mistake that would have cost time at a later stage, a spokesman for BTL said. Eni and BP declined to comment. Originally used to underpin digital currency bitcoin, blockchain is a distributed record of transactions, or other data, maintained by a network of computers on the internet. “Use of such technology can help by streamlining back office processes, leading to reduced risk, better protection against cyber threats and ultimately significant cost savings,” said Andrew Woosey, partner at consultancy EY which helped oversee the testing phase. Various commodity traders have started to test blockchain’s electronic transaction-processing system which promises to cutting out middlemen. But adaptation has been slow in the typically conservative commodity business for fear of losing discretion in dealings and complicating trading.

The 16 megawatt (MW) Wildflower Solar project will be built in California and has secured a 20 year plus power purchase agreement (PPA) with California’s Sacramento Municipal Utility District. Lightsource BP will also develop a 9 MW solar project in New Mexico which has a PPA with New Mexico’s Continental Divide Electric Cooperative. No financial details were released. Both projects will be constructed and completed in 2019, Lightsource BP CEO Nick Boyle said in a phone interview. Oil major BP acquired a 43 percent stake in Lightsource last year. “The U.S. is a hugely important market for BP and it is hugely important for Lightsource BP,” Boyle said. “We are working on a very significant pipeline in the U.S. and this announcement is one of many that will flow though,” he said. Earlier this year Lightsource BP bought a 135 MW portfolio of six solar assets in Pennsylvania and Maryland from Orion Renewable Energy Group LLC.

The sale, which is expected to complete in the coming weeks, would mark the end of BP’s 50-year-old partnership in the Gulf of Suez Petroleum Company (GUPCO) as the London-based company focuses on developing Egypt’s large offshore gas reserves. Dragon Oil, a subsidiary of Dubai’s Emirates National Oil Company (ENOC), has said it plans to expand its international operations and boost its production to 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2025. GUPCO produces over 70,000 barrels per day of oil and 400 million cubic feet per day of gas, the sources said. A BP spokesman declined to comment. The Egyptian Petroleum Ministry and the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) had no immediate comment. ENOC could not be reached for comment. The GUPCO sale has received the initial approval of Egypt’s Petroleum Ministry after it had objected to an agreement BP had reached last year with North African-focused oil and gas company SDX Energy to buy the asset, one of the sources said. Dragon Oil’s main asset is Turkmenistan’s Cheleken field, where it produces close to 90,000 bpd. In Egypt, it has a 100% interest in the East Zeit Bay block. The cash raised from the sale will help BP towards its goal of selling more than $5 billion of assets following the $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP’s onshore oil and gas assets in the United States last year. BP’s total net production in Egypt reached 49,000 bpd of oil and gas liquids and 878 million cubic feet per day of gas in 2018, according to its annual report. In February, BP launched the Giza/Fayoum field in the West Nile Delta offshore area which is expected to produce around 60,000 boe/d.

366,2017-09-19,2017,9.0,19,,Azeri parliament to ratify new deal with BP-led consortium in 2017,"BAKU (Reuters) - Azerbaijan’s parliament is expected to ratify an oilfield development contract with a BP-led consortium before the end of 2017, the head of state oil group SOCAR said on Tuesday. BP and Azerbaijan agreed last week to extend to 2050 the contract to develop the country’s biggest oilfields - Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG), a deal dubbed “the contract of the century” when first signed in 1994 until 2024. The new contract secures large investment in Azerbaijan’s oil sector over decades and a one-off bonus of $3.6 billion for the government, a welcome boost for a country that has struggled with a sharp drop in oil prices in the past three years. “The new contract is expected to be submitted to the parliament before the end of 2017, coming into force after ratification,” Rovnag Abdullayev, president of state-owned energy company SOCAR, told Reuters. He said the main goal of the new contract was to spur interest among SOCAR’s foreign partners in new long-term investments and to secure sustainable exploration of the oilfields. “Today our financial and technological resources are much more advanced than back in the 1990s, when the first “contract of the century” was negotiated,” Abdullayev said. “That allows Azerbaijan to act independently, having an effect on the final outcome of all negotiations.” Abdullayev said that according to the new contract Azerbaijan’s direct share in profitable oil amounted to 75 percent and the ratio was not subject to any variations from the start until the end of the contract, thus contributing to stability of the national income. Under the new production sharing agreement, SOCAR will increase its share to 25 percent from 11.65 percent, while BP’s stake declines to 30.37 percent from 35.8 percent. BP will remain the operator. Stakes of other firms in the BP-led consortium have also been reduced. Chevron now has 9.57 percent, Inpex 9.31 percent, Statoil 7.27 percent, ExxonMobil 6.79 percent, TPAO 5.73 percent, Itochu 3.65 percent and ONGC Videsh 2.31 percent. The ACG fields produce 585,000 barrels per day, accounting for three quarters of the Azerbaijan’s oil output, but production is expected to rise as the partners could invest up to $40 billion in the next 32 years.

After a slow start to the year, global oil demand recovered in the second quarter of 2017 and was expected to grow by 1.4 to 1.5 million barrels per day, Brian Gilvary told Reuters. “Global demand is looking pretty strong, and prices will firm around the levels seen today,” he said. Brent crude oil prices averaged $51.71 a barrel in the first half of 2017 and are currently just below $53 a barrel. Global demand was at around 95 million bpd in 2016. Brent crude oil prices were expected to remain broadly unchanged in 2018 as U.S. shale production is able to expand at these levels, effectively capping prices. “We can now see where the price elasticity is. As the price comes up to $52-$53 a barrel we start to see some uptick in activity, as it drops to $45, we start to see that curtailing.” “For 2018 something around $45-$55 a barrel is probably a good range,” Gilvary said.

369,2017-10-31,2017,10.0,31,"Karolin Schaps, Ron Bousso",BP revives share buybacks as years of austerity pay off,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP (BP.L) will become the first major European oil and gas company to resume share buybacks since the 2014 price slump, a sign years of austerity have paid off. Tuesday’s surprise announcement came as the British oil company reported a doubling in third-quarter profit, and in a week crude prices hit two year highs above $60 a barrel. Coupled with strong growth in its oil and gas production and cash flow, the resumption of buybacks in the fourth quarter lifted BP’s shares to their highest in over three years, when oil prices were still around $100 a barrel. The move comes as BP gradually shakes off the impact of the deadly 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill, known as Macondo, that cost it over $63 billion in clean-up costs and penalties. “After three years of oil price correction and seven years after Macondo we are now back into more normal state of growing the business in current environment and we can deal with prices that go lower,” BP Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary told Reuters. BP is the first among Europe’s top oil and gas companies to reintroduce buybacks, although some are making other moves to woo shareholders. Norway’s Statoil STL.OL, for example, has said it will stop offering a “scrip” dividend - paid in shares rather than cash - in the fourth quarter, while France’s Total (TOTF.PA) plans to do so next year. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) reports results on Thursday. “Today’s announcement is a very positive surprise, emphasizing the progress made in the reset of the BP in the aftermath of Macondo and in the context of lower oil prices,” UBS analysts said. In one of the clearest signs yet that the oil company has turned a corner, BP said it was able to balance its books so far this year at $49 a barrel, excluding Macondo payments, as years of cost cuts pay off. Four months ago, BP’s breakeven level was still at around $60 a barrel. BP will be able to balance its books at $50 or even $45 a barrel next year, Gilvary said. The London-based firm is working on an assumption Brent crude will average $50-55 a barrel next year as global inventories gradually return to normal, he added. The fortunes of Europe’s other top oil and gas companies diverged in the third quarter, with Italy’s ENI (ENI.MI) and Statoil missing profit expectations, while Total benefited from higher production and an increase in earnings at its huge downstream business. BP also got a boost from growing production after it started six major projects so far this year, as well as lower payments for the Macondo spill. BP’s oil and gas production in the first nine months of the year rose by more than 9.6 percent from a year earlier to 2.427 million barrels of oil equivalent. It also saw improved earnings in its downstream business where refinery profit margins rose sharply after Hurricane Harvey knocked out around a quarter of U.S. refininig capacity for several weeks. At 0915 GMT, BP shares were up 3.6 percent at 519.71 pence, after trading as high as 522.2 pence. The oil major reported third-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, the company’s definition of net income, of $1.87 billion, exceeding analysts’ forecast of $1.58 billion. The company generated $1.8 billion in surplus cash over the first nine months of the year, compared with $1.4 billion in shares issued as part of the scrip dividend. As of the current quarter, BP will buy back the equivalent number of shares it is issuing as part of its scrip dividend scheme through which investors can opt to receive dividend payouts in shares rather than cash. It will buy back around $1.6 billion worth of shares a year in order to offset the dilutive effect of the scrip dividend program, Gilvary said. “The move to start buybacks is welcomed by us to neutralize the scrip dividend and reduce the discount the market puts on the yield,” said Rohan Murphy, energy analyst at BP shareholder Allianz Global Investors.

373,2019-02-14,2019,2.0,14,Ron Bousso,"As renewables soar, BP sees China hitting brakes on energy growth","LONDON (Reuters) - Global demand for renewable power will soar at an unprecedented pace over the coming decades, BP said in a benchmark report on Thursday, while China’s energy growth is seen sharply decelerating as its economic expansion slows. Still, China is set to remain the largest energy consumer by a long stretch into 2040 although India should overtake it in terms of demand growth beginning in the next decade, the British oil and gas giant said in its 2019 Energy Outlook. China’s energy demand rose by 5.9 percent over the past 20 years, but is set to grow by only 1 percent by 2040 as its economy shifts from energy-intensive industries to services and as Beijing introduces stricter rules on air pollution. BP revised down its forecast of China’s energy demand by 7 percent from last year’s report, “reflecting the pace at which China is adjusting to a more sustainable pattern of economic growth”. Under BP’s base-case Evolving Transition scenario, global energy demand will increase by around one third by 2040, driven by rapidly expanding middle classes in Asia. Renewables are expected to be the fastest-growing energy source with an annual gain of 7.1 percent, accounting for half the growth in global energy. Their share in primary energy is seen rising from 4 percent today to around 15 percent by 2040. Compared with the level in last year’s report, BP raised by 9 percent its 2040 forecast of demand for renewable power such as solar and wind. Renewables and natural gas, the least-polluting fossil fuel, will account for 85 percent of the growth in energy demand. “Renewables will penetrate the energy system quicker than any other fuel ever,” BP Chief Economist Spencer Dale told reporters before the release of the report. Solar power will increase by a factor of 10 by 2040 and wind by a factor of five under BP’s basic scenario. While the share of oil in world energy demand rose from 1 percent to 10 over 45 years in the early 20th century, renewables are set to reach the same share over 25 years, Dale said. In a world struggling to tackle climate change by curbing greenhouse gas emissions and to bring billions of people out of poverty, demand for electricity is set to account for around three quarters of the growth in energy. Global energy-related carbon emissions hit a historic high of 32.5 gigatons in 2017, after being flat for three years, due to increased energy demand and the slowing of energy efficiency improvements, the International Energy Agency said last year. The unprecedented growth in renewables is, however, not sufficient to meet U.N.-backed targets set under the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement to curb carbon emissions in order to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, he added. Under the Evolving Transition scenario, carbon emissions will grow by 10 percent by 2040, much faster than in the past. BP expects oil demand to plateau at around 108 million barrels per day (bpd) by the mid-2030s, amid growth in electric vehicles and higher engine efficiency. Transportation continues to be the main driver of growth in oil consumption, with its share remaining stable at around 55 percent by 2040. Demand for transport services will almost double by 2040, but gains of nearly 50 percent in engine efficiency for cars and trucks mean energy consumed by the sector should grow by only 20 percent. Oil used to produce plastics is the largest source of demand growth over the period, increasing by 7 million bpd to 22 million bpd. The growth in oil supply will initially come from rapidly expanding U.S. shale production, which BP expects will grow by 6 million bpd over the next 10 years, peaking at 10.5 million bpd in the late 2020s. As U.S. shale output declines, production from members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will take the lead. BP warned that an escalation in trade disputes could significantly reduce energy demand due to slowing economic growth. A 6 percent reduction in global gross domestic product in the period to 2040 versus BP’s base-case scenario would lead to a 4 percent decline in energy demand, it said. Lower demand and slowing energy trade flows would have the biggest impact on oil and gas exporting countries such as Russia and the United States, BP said.

375,2017-11-27,2017,11.0,27,Ron Bousso,A BP North Sea field to test U.S. policy on Iran,"LONDON (Reuters) - A small gas field on the edge of the British North Sea could become a litmus test for U.S. policy towards Iran. London-based BP this week agreed to sell to North Sea producer Serica Energy three fields in the aging offshore basin, including the Rhum field which is co-owned by a subsidiary of Iran’s national oil company. For Serica, the $400 million deal will increase its production sevenfold. It nevertheless hinges on the British company receiving a license from U.S. sanctions enforcement authorities at a time when President Donald Trump is flexing his muscles against Tehran. For BP and its American Chief Executive Bob Dudley, selling Rhum, which BP discovered in the 1970s, removes a potential source of friction as it mends its ties with the U.S. government following the deadly 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Rhum was shut down for most of the first half of the decade due to western sanctions on Tehran before resuming normal operations in 2016 following a landmark nuclear deal between Iran and the world’s top powers. Because of the Iranian involvement, BP needs a license from the U.S. Treasury’s sanctions enforcement arm - the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) - allowing U.S. nationals and companies to take part in the field’s operations. The license was renewed in September, a month before Trump sought to reverse the U.S. position on the nuclear deal with Iran. Serica will apply for its own license in the coming months, Tony Craven Walker, Serica’s Executive Chairman, told Reuters. “Getting an OFAC license for Serica to assume operatorship of Rhum is part of the conditions of the transaction with BP,” Walker said. OFAC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. BP, founded more than a century ago as the Anglo-Persian oil company, will lobby the British government to lend its support in requesting the U.S. administration to grant the license to Serica, according to a source at BP. Though not a prerequisite to operate the field, the license is needed as a back-up in case of an emergency that requires U.S. equipment and companies, Walker said. “Given the nature of the operations and our intentions to meet the same obligations as BP we don’t foresee any reason for the license not to be granted,” Walker said. France’s Total, which recently opened an office in Washington, is also closely monitoring the U.S. position on Iran which could decide the fate of its plans to develop a huge offshore gas field in Iran. SNAP-BACK Things could change quickly after Trump’s decision in October not to certify that Tehran is complying with the nuclear deal. The ball now lies in the court of the U.S. Congress, which will decide next month whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the agreement. “A snap-back of U.S sanctions is a risk,” Walker said. “But it does not necessarily impact our operations in Rhum unless the European Union and UK also implement a snap-back and there is no indication that this is likely to occur.” Serica board member Jeffrey Harris, a U.S. citizen, stepped down in order to guarantee it does not violate U.S. sanctions still in place that ban Americans from dealing with Iran. Serica hopes to complete the acquisition of the Bruce, Keith and Rhum fields from BP by mid-2018. The deal will increase its production to around 21,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which around 85 percent is gas. Serica and its partner, Iranian Oil Company, plan to renew drilling of a third well at the Rhum field next year, Walker said. After being forced to shut down in 2010 when Western nations imposed sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear program, Rhum resumed production in 2013 when Britain agreed to set up a temporary management scheme whereby all revenue due to Tehran would be held until sanctions were lifted. Following the removal of European Union and United Nations sanctions on Iran in January 2016, the temporary management scheme ceased but BP still obtained an OFAC license.

The corporate support for the plan, which would impose a $40 tax on each ton of carbon dioxide produced, follows a decision by President Donald Trump to pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement, a global pact that fights climate change by slashing emissions from burning fossil fuels. “This plan would achieve significantly greater emissions reductions than all current and prior climate regulations, while helping America’s businesses and workers get ahead,” according to the advertisement from the Climate Leadership Council. The ad bore the corporate symbols of companies such as Exxon, BP, Shell (RDSa.L), Total (TOTF.PA), GM (GM.N), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), and PepsiCo PEP.N. The Climate Leadership Council proposal was co-authored by James Baker, secretary of state during the administration of George H. W. Bush, and George Shultz, secretary of state under Ronald Reagan. The proposed $40 per ton tax on carbon would rise in price over time, and revenues would be paid into the Social Security Administration. While the plan echoes past attempts by parts of the Republican Party to address climate change, it could be a non-starter. Trump has expressed doubt over the existence of climate change and has said efforts to fight it put the United States at a competitive disadvantage. A White House official did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The administration has previously said a carbon tax is not under consideration. An overwhelming majority of scientists believe that burning fossil fuels drives global climate change, has raised sea levels and triggered more frequent and powerful storms. Oil giants like Exxon and BP have been criticized for their roles in contributing to climate change through the production and marketing of fossil fuels. Still, in recent years, they have supported government efforts to regulate emissions, including through the Paris climate deal agreed by nearly 200 nations in 2015. Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods had repeatedly urged Trump to keep the United States in the Paris deal, saying the country’s abundant reserves of low-carbon natural gas made it well-placed to perform within the agreement.

He had no further details. However, Mamadou Faye, director of Senegal’s state oil firm Petrosen, said no formal request had yet been made by the companies. “There is no substance to reports concerning Cairn’s assets in Senegal,” a Cairn spokesperson said. BP (BP.L) declined to comment. Cairn’s share price rose around 5 percent on Tuesday, BP’s was up around 1 percent. Oil majors have been increasingly homing in on the waters off Senegal, as well as neighbors Mauritania and Gambia, where they suspect hundreds of millions of barrels lie. A deal would further boost BP’s position in Senegal following a joint venture with Kosmos Energy in December last year, which revealed a major gas discovery in May. BP also has investments in two other offshore fields there. Senegal and Mauritania are two areas BP is targeting over the next decade and it plans to spend billions in the Tortue LNG project which is expected to produce its first gas in 2021. The deepwater SNE project is the first oil development in the West African nation. Cairn shares the project with Australia’s Woodside (WPL.AX) and FAR Ltd (FAR.AX). The companies expect to start producing by 2021. Woodside, Australia’s biggest independent oil and gas producer, bought a 35 percent stake from ConocoPhillips last year for up to $430 million, or $2.20 a barrel based on reserves of 561 million barrels at the time, before these were upgraded to nearly 650 million barrels. FAR Ltd has said the project could start producing before 2021, and at a higher rate than flagged before. Oil majors including Total SA and China’s CNOOC Ltd have also been investing in the waters off this part of the West African coast.

378,2016-05-31,2016,5.0,31,"Marianna Parraga, Sarah McFarlane",Oil tankers in limbo as Venezuela's PDVSA fails to pay BP: sources,"HOUSTON/LONDON (Reuters) - Four tankers carrying over 2 million barrels of U.S. crude are stuck at sea and cannot discharge at a Caribbean terminal because Venezuela’s PDVSA has not yet paid supplier BP Plc, according to two sources and Thomson Reuters vessel tracking data. The cargoes are part of a tender Petroleos de Venezuela [PDVSA.UL], known as PDVSA, awarded in March to BP and China Oil. The deal was to import some 8 million barrels of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude so Venezuela could dilute its extra heavy crudes and feed its Caribbean refineries. While three cargoes for this tender were delivered in April, seven other vessels, including BP’s four hired ones, are waiting to discharge, leaving up to 3.85 million barrels of WTI in limbo. PDVSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company’s cash crunch, which also affected its oil imports late last year, have added to a backlog of tankers since March due to malfunctioning loading arms at Jose, Venezuela’s main crude port. PDVSA initially offered to pay for the imports with Venezuelan oil, but negotiations for those swaps failed as the proposed loading windows and crude grades did not work for BP, a source close to the talks said. Amid low crude prices, declining exports and a brutal recession at home, PDVSA has since 2015 delayed payments to suppliers. As a result, service firms including Schlumberger, Halliburton and Petrex have curtailed operations in the OPEC country. The payment delays are also raising questions about who will pay for demurrage, or the daily costs for delays. Three of the BP tankers have been anchored for over 30 days. As China already lifts Venezuelan crude as part of broader oil-for-loans deals, its companies have agreed on swaps for this tender, the sources said. Issues with loading arms to receive tankers at Jose port have doubled wait times for shippers since March. PDVSA said in a statement that installation of replacement equipment in the port’s southern dock were successfully concluded on Tuesday. Some 30 dirty tankers are currently waiting around PDVSA’s ports in Venezuela and Curacao. PDVSA has become one of the largest buyers of U.S. crude since last month even with a narrow arbitrage that makes most exports unattractive, analysts have said, but payment delays could stymie its bid to continue imports.

380,2016-03-04,2016,3.0,4,"Dmitry Zhdannikov, Ron Bousso",BP boss gets 20 percent rise in total pay despite firm's $6.5 billion loss,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP (BP.L) Chief Executive Bob Dudley’s total pay rose 20 percent to nearly $20 million in 2015, a year when the oil major settled most of its U.S. oil spill litigations but also posted a record loss as crude prices plummeted. BP has slashed thousands of jobs and sharply cut investments over the past year in the face of the market downturn, while reaching a landmark $20 billion settlement to resolve most claims from its deadly 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Dudley’s pay has risen steadily since he took office following the spill and has become a regular point of tension with shareholders. The firm’s annual shareholder meeting is scheduled for April. Last month BP reported a $6.5 billion loss for 2015 as its underlying replacement cost profit, its definition of net income, dropped to $5.9 billion in 2015 from $12.1 billion the previous year. BP argues it needs to remain competitive and its remuneration is lower than most U.S. rivals. In its annual report on Friday, BP said executive directors received no increase in base salary in 2015 and that senior leadership would not see salary increases this year either. Dudley’s total pay was boosted by a payment to his U.S. pension scheme and that rise stems from deferred bonus payments, the company said. Ann Dowling, chair of BP’s remuneration committee, said the company delivered strong operating and safety performances throughout 2015. The company’s operating cash flow and underlying replacement cost profit were both well ahead of targets set for 2015, BP said. “The oil price is outside BP’s control, but executives performed strongly in managing the things they could control and for which they are accountable. BP surpassed expectations on most measures and directors’ remuneration reflects this,” Dowling said in the report. BP said that while industry costs had come down sharply following the near 70 percent decline in oil prices over the past 20 months, “this will be a tough period of intense change for the industry as it adapts to this new reality.” BP has said it expects oil prices to remain low in the near term. Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said in the current low oil price environment BP aimed to ensure it covered capital expenditure and shareholder distributions with operating cash flow. “We anticipate that all the actions we are taking will capture more deflation and drive the point of rebalance to below $60 per barrel,” he said. BP’s oil and gas proved reserve replacement ratio dropped for a second year to 61 percent, compared with 63 percent in 2014, indicating that the company has not discovered or acquired sufficient reserves to offset production and the natural decline of wells. The fall was due to a low number of final investment decisions adding new projects and reduced activity in Alaska and the U.S. Lower 48” states, BP said.

The Mercury Hope supertanker, chartered by BP and carrying about 2 million barrels of Angolan oil, offloaded part of the cargo in late May at Qingdao and has since been at sea in nearby waters, said the sources with knowledge of the matter. The tanker began offloading the remaining part of its cargo to Shandong Qingyuan Group, a privately-controlled refiner based at Linzi, Shandong province, late on Wednesday. The group, which operates a 104,000 barrels per day refiner, is a regular customer of BP which has expanded its crude oil marketing to Chinese independent refiners since 2015 after China opened crude oil imports to nearly 40 local plants. Mercury Hope is one of four supertankers that BP brought to China carrying Angolan oil several months ago, but which have been held up or delayed off China’s east coast, unable to fully discharge oil due to slowing buying from private refiners. BP did not respond to a request for comment. An official at Shandong Qingyuan’s management office said she was not in a position to comment. In early July, BP discharged nearly 1 million barrels of oil from Texas, another of the four tankers, also to Qingyuan. Qingyuan, one of China’s largest independently run lubricant producers, has received an annual crude import quota of 4.04 million tonnes for the last two years.

One of these will target a prospect in the southeast Barents on the maritime border with Russia and could contain significant new resources. “Yes, it can, but it also (has) quite a bit of risk,” Chief Executive Karl Johnny Hersvik said in an interview at Aker BP’s office near Oslo. “It’s an interesting prospect.” Aker BP, which is 40 percent owned by Aker Capital and 30 percent by BP, operates the licence with partners including Russia’s Lukoil and Norway’s Statoil . Statoil recently completed the highly anticipated Korpfjell well some 100 km further north, but found only a small, non-commercial quantity of gas, contrary to expectations of a multi-million or even a billion-barrels discovery. “The hype of the Barents Sea was too high... It’s not game over, but it’s worthwhile to cool it a bit,” Hersvik said. In 2017, Aker BP plans to drill eight exploration wells in Norway, including five partner-operated wells. Aker’s production outlook for 2017 is 135,000-140,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day, Hersvik said, but said this could be revised depending on a capacity increase at Lundin’s Edvard Grieg field. Aker BP’s Ivar Aasen field sends oil and gas to the Edvard Grieg platform for further processing and export, and is thus dependent on it capacity. Hersvik said he expected a “slight decline” in production in 2018 and 2019 compared with 2017, before the start-up of Statoil’s Johan Sverdrup field in late 2019, where Aker BP holds an 11.57 percent stake. Oil companies have sharply reduced their costs in recent years to compensate for a fall in crude prices but there is still room for cuts, including some at Sverdrup, Hersvik said. Due to start production in late 2019, the Sverdrup field holds an estimated 2-3 billion barrels of oil equivalents, the largest found off Norway in decades.

The sale of the fuel business, comprising 527 petrol stations and 16 development sites was flagged in September and follows its earlier exit from a disastrous foray into hardware, which led to a A$1.8 billion impairment charge. “Hardware wasn’t so great ... this is another area of their business that they weren’t really managing well,” said Juliana Roadley, a market analyst at stockbroker Commonwealth Securities. Woolworths “didn’t understand” the fuel business and would be best to concentrate on selling groceries, she added. The fuel sold at Woolworths’ petrol stations is currently supplied by Caltex Australia (CTX.AX), which also bid for the business. Under the new arrangement BP will eventually supply and sell the fuel. The fuel business reported earnings before tax and significant items of A$117.8 million for the year ended June 30. Its sale “is not expected to have a material impact on Woolworths Group earnings”, the company said. “The release of A$1.785 billion from the sale will be used to strengthen our balance sheet and reinvest in our core businesses,” Woolworths Chief Executive Brad Banducci said. The 92-year-old company posted its first annual loss since its 1993 listing in August, hit hard by the hardware impairment and squeezed margins amid a price war with rival Coles, owned by Wesfarmers Ltd (WES.AX), and new entrants such as Germany’s ALDI Inc [ALDIEI.UL]. The deal, which was signed on Christmas Eve, is subject to regulatory approval and is not expected to be completed until January 2018 at the earliest, the statement said. It also involves an agreement to continue a fuel voucher scheme and the parties will jointly trial a convenience business at 200 of the petrol stations. Woolworths shares rose 2.7 percent to a two-month high in early trade, while the broader market rose 0.73 percent. BP downstream chief executive Tufan Erginbilgic said in a separate statement that it has similar and successful partnerships globally with retailers such as Marks and Spencer (MKS.L).

The cut is the company’s second price drop this year and comes after all of the country’s ‘big six’ suppliers raised their average prices around 10 percent in April in line with an increase in the energy regulator’s price cap. Pure Planet said it would cut its gas price by 6 percent from May 8, which translates to a 2.4 percent fall, or 24 pounds ($31) saving on an average dual fuel bill to 962 pounds a year. The company said unseasonably warm temperatures over February and May had seen gas demand and wholesale gas prices fall in Britain, allowing it to lower prices. Pure Planet has around 100,000 customers and is one of some 50 brands challenging the big six energy firms for market share. $1 = 0.7688 pounds

BP was the largest shareholder in New Zealand’s only oil refiner before it sold the stock in block trade on Thursday night at NZ$2.32 per share, stock exchange filings show, below Thursday’s closing price of NZ$2.49. Shares in the company, which had been in a trading halt due to the transaction, fell 4 percent to NZ$2.39 when they resumed trading on Friday afternoon. New Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index was up 0.2 percent on the day. “BP regularly undertakes reviews of its assets, partnerships and shareholdings around the world and today’s transaction is the outcome of one such global portfolio review,” BP’s head of Asia-Pacific fuels Andy Holmes said in a statement. BP did not disclose the buyer of the stake, but said in a statement that it had retained an 10.1-percent interest in the company, via local subsidiaries. “BP’s reduction in shareholding does not affect the existing contractual arrangements between Refining NZ and BP, including the processing agreement,” New Zealand Refining said in a statement. Exxon Mobil Corp, via a subsidiary, and New Zealand’s Z Energy Ltd are the other major shareholders in New Zealand Refining.

391,2016-06-10,2016,6.0,10,"Henrik Stolen, Karolin Schaps",BP and Det norske agree $1.3 billion Norwegian oil merger,"OSLO/LONDON (Reuters) - Oil companies BP (BP.L) and Det norske DETNOR.OL have agreed to merge their Norwegian businesses in a $1.3 billion all-share deal to cut costs, challenge Statoil’s STL.OL dominance of the local industry and look for more acquisitions. The new venture, which could produce over a tenth of Norway’s oil output, will offer BP an opportunity to tap into new oil production and reserves in the next decade after it cut back exploration in recent years. Norway’s seas, unlike Britain’s, are offering more opportunities for exploration, with authorities opening up new acreage in the Arctic. In particular, BP will gain exposure to the giant Johan Sverdrup field, the largest oil find in Norway in 30 years, in which Det norske has a 11.57 percent stake, and which is expected to start production in late 2019. The merged entity, to be called Aker BP, will be part owned by Aker, an investment vehicle that is Det norske’s main shareholder and controlled by Norwegian billionaire Kjell-Inge Roekke. It will hold 40 percent, with BP taking 30 percent and the remaining 30 percent controlled by other shareholders. The new company, which will include all of Det norske’s assets but only a small proportion of BP’s, will also provide an opportunity to cut costs as oil companies worldwide battle with a 55-percent fall in the price of crude since June 2014. “There is a need in the industry for closer collaboration, for pooling of rigs, for harmonizing standards, all to get the costs down,” said Martijn Rats, head of European oil and gas equity research at Morgan Stanley. “For BP, this transaction is important but at the scale of the company, it is quite modest.” For Det norske, the deal will strengthen its position as the biggest independent operator of Norwegian oil platforms and challenge the dominance of state-controlled Statoil, responsible for 60 percent of the Nordic country’s oil and gas output. Last month, Statoil increased its stake in Swedish oil firm Lundin Petroleum (LUPE.ST) to 20 percent, one of its partners in Johan Sverdrup, bolstering its dominance. After that deal, Det norske CEO Karl-Johnny Hersvik, who will head the new entity, called for a bigger competitor to Statoil. At 5.10 a.m. ET, BP shares were down 1.3 percent, roughly tracking the European oil and gas index .SXEP, while Det norske shares were up 8.3 percent. “This deal is clearly positive for Det norske. (It) creates a significantly stronger company, with a broader portfolio and stronger balance sheet, and the pricing reflects positively on Det norske’s existing portfolio,” Carnegie analyst Kjetil Bakken said in a note to clients. Aker BP will be looking for acquisitions. “We will look predominantly for oil assets and will put value over volume,” Hersvik told a news conference. The combined company will hold an estimated 723 million barrels of oil equivalent P50 reserves, with a 2015 joint production of approximately 122,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, the companies said. A quarterly dividend policy will be introduced by the new company, with the first payment planned for the fourth quarter of 2016, conditional upon the approval of creditors. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter, pending shareholder and regulatory approval. The second-largest shareholder in Det norske, Folketrygdfondet, has already said it would back the deal. The Norwegian oil minister also welcomed it. KLP, Det norske’s sixth-biggest investor with a 1.3 percent stake, said the deal was a good solution for the companies and shareholders, but portfolio manager John Harald Henriksen added it was too early to say if KLP would vote for it.

393,2018-03-13,2018,3.0,13,Devika  Krishna Kumar,BP expects strong compliance for marine sulfur emissions caps,"NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Oil major BP Plc expects more than 90 percent of the world’s shipping fleet will comply with new regulations slashing sulfur levels ships are allowed to burn starting 2020, a company executive said on Tuesday. Coming International Maritime Organization (IMO) rules will cut the amount of sulfur emissions that ships worldwide are allowed from 3.5 percent to 0.5 percent by 2020. “Potential non-compliance is a significant issue that the market has been contending with,” Jason Breslaw, who leads BP’s distillate trading origination across the Americas, said at an industry conference in New Orleans. Breslaw said BP expects only about 9 percent of the industry is likely to be non-compliant as the rule takes effect. The compliance level has significant implications for demand for high-sulfur fuel oil; BP’s estimates fall well short of other analyst estimates of about 30 percent non-compliance. The IMO has said there would be no delays or exceptions to the coming rules, whether or not the industry takes the steps it needs to comply, and warned that all parties face consequences if they do not play their part. Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie estimates about 30 percent non-compliance, said Alan Gelder, vice president of refining, chemicals and oil markets. “At the moment nobody is really doing anything ... with a number of the shippers playing chicken with the regulator, does the regulator blink? We don’t know,” Gelder told Reuters. One way ships can comply with coming standards is to retrofit vessels with costly scrubbers, which can reduce sulfur emissions even if ships continue to burn dirty fuel. But there are significant concerns with this process as well, industry participants said. The cost of installing scrubbers is about $3 million to $10 million, said Anil Rajguru, vice president of process safety at Fluor Corp. “Right now less than 500 ships have scrubbers. We’re talking more like 50,000 and it could take more than a decade before scrubbers are fitted on (all) the vessels,” Rajguru said.

394,2019-05-06,2019,5.0,6,Jessica Resnick-Ault,BP to boost Gulf of Mexico spending as shale-focused rivals pull back,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BP Plc on Monday announced new production units in the Gulf of Mexico, enhancing its standing as the largest producer there at a time when rival global oil majors are scrambling to expand vast U.S. onshore shale drilling. Britain-based BP will add two new subsea production units about two miles (3.2 km) south of its existing giant Thunder Horse platform, with two wells added in the near term and eight total wells planned, the company said on Monday. BP did not disclose the cost of the investment. The investment runs against current industry trends that emphasize spending on shale, which has propelled U.S. production to more than 12 million barrels a day (bpd), making it the largest producer in the world. U.S. offshore production accounts for 1.8 million bpd, but has grown more slowly. Like its rivals, BP has completed a massive onshore acquisition, buying BHP Billiton’s onshore assets for $10.5 billion to improve its shale position. That new investment has not detracted from the company’s plans for the Gulf. People familiar with BP’s investment decisions told Reuters that the Gulf’s vast oil reservoirs and increasingly affordable platforms make the formation a good hedge against the risks of shale, where industry’s per-well productivity has dropped by 14 percent from its 2016 high. Among deepwater basins, the Gulf of Mexico’s reliable regulatory climate makes the region particularly attractive, analysts say. BP said it plans to increase its Gulf production to about 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) by the mid 2020s. That’s about a fifth of the region’s total production. The company’s Gulf production has already increased more than 60 percent from 2013 to more than 300,000 boed. “Those big fields keep on giving,” Starlee Sykes, the company’s president for operations in the region, told Reuters. The new development at Thunder Horse will add 50,000 gross boed of production, with first oil expected in 2021. That’s more crude from a single project than the total Permian production BP acquired as part of the deal with BHP Billiton. BP used new seismic imaging capabilities to identify an additional 1 billion barrels of oil in place at the Thunder Horse field. “One of the significant advantages of deepwater or offshore wells relative to onshore U.S. wells is their high productivity,” said Emeka Emembolu, BP’s Gulf of Mexico vice president for reservoir development. “On average, Deepwater Gulf of Mexico wells produce around 5,000 barrels of oil per day.” Some offshore wells have production rates starting at 30,000 barrels per day, he said. That’s compared with an average of just 650 barrels a day for Permian wells, according to U.S. Energy Department statistics. Offshore developments traditionally require hefty upfront investment, but improved recovery technologies have reduced project costs. BP has reduced its per-barrel costs to $40 a barrel or less – on par with wells in the best shale formations. “Growth in onshore oil can only provide 15-20% of what the market needs year-on-year in terms of volume growth, so that’s why you see continued activity in the Gulf of Mexico, in offshore Brazil, and new basins popping up,” said Andrew Slaughter, executive director, Deloitte Center for Energy Solutions. Still, in the United States shale has overshadowed the Gulf. Chevron Corp and Occidental Petroleum Corp are locked in a battle for Anadarko Petroleum Corp, with both touting onshore and liquefied natural gas assets as key attractions of the deal, rather than Anadarko’s Gulf platforms. Anadarko produces roughly 140,000 bpd from the Gulf. Separately, Exxon Mobil Corp has started a sale process to identify a buyer for 45,000 bpd of Gulf production interests and Royal Dutch Shell agreed to sell a production platform last month. BP has maintained a position in each of the five largest Gulf fields, and it also is one of the few of late bidding on areas not adjacent to existing properties in the Gulf. The rest - mostly the majors and a few niche regionally-focused independent companies - have centered their exploration around acreage next to existing platforms.

395,2017-04-17,2017,4.0,17,,BP says crews brought leaking Alaskan well under control,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - BP Plc said workers on Alaska’s North Slope had brought under control a company-operated well that spewed oil and gas over the weekend. The leak was discovered on Friday and a team from BP, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and local government was brought in to coordinate efforts. The team halted the well leaks overnight, BP said in a statement on Monday. The volume of the leak was not disclosed. A BP spokesman said details of what caused the loss of control were not available. The oil producer had retained Halliburton Co’s well control specialists to kill the well, the spokesman said. ADEC earlier said in a statement that well pipe had temporarily “jacked up” or risen vertically about 3 feet to 4 feet, causing a pressure gauge to break off. BP has dealt with several spills and leaks in Alaska in the past. In 2006, a corroded pipeline released nearly 5,000 barrels of crude oil, the largest oil spill in the North Slope at the time. Another spill occurred in 2009 that saw just over 1,000 barrels leak. In 2010, a BP-operated drilling rig called Deepwater Horizon exploded, killing 11 people and spilling nearly 5 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, making it the largest oil spill in U.S. federal waters. BP eventually agreed to pay $18.7 billion to settle all federal and state claims related to the spill.

Swiss bank UBS also slumped, down 7 percent, after reporting a surprise outflow of funds from its flagship wealth management business, overshadowing its best annual results since 2010 and a higher than expected dividend payout. BP fell 7.3 percent after reporting its worst annual loss in more than 20 years in 2015. It announced thousands more job cuts following a deep rout in oil prices and maintained its dividend, but the weak results and outlook are bound to pile pressure on the company which has had to increase borrowing. “BP hasn’t blinked on its dividend, but it is playing chicken with the oil price. BP’s dividend is a mile away from being covered by earnings and the market is saying that this is unsustainable. They are a chasm away from their cash break-even oil price of around $60 dollars per barrel,” said Steve Clayton, head of equities research at Hargreaves Lansdown. The STOXX Europe 600 Oil and Gas index dropped 3.4 percent after crude oil prices fell again on worries about top energy consumer China and rising oil supply. Shares in BG Group , Royal Dutch Shell and Tullow Oil fell 1.6 to 3.7 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst index dropped 1.5 percent by 0904 GMT, after closing 0.2 percent weaker in the previous session. The index is down more than 7 percent so far this year. BHP Billiton fell 4.8 percent after Standard & Poor’s cut the world’s largest miner’s credit rating and warned it might be lowered further if measures to shore up cash levels were not taken, cementing expectations BHP will slash its dividend for the first time in 15 years. However, some companies advanced on the back of encouraging results and positive company news. Shares in Danske Bank rose 4 percent after reporting a forecast-beating pretax profit in the fourth quarter, thanks to higher trading income. The bank also plans to launch a share buy-back programme. Sainsbury’s rose 2 percent after Britain’s second biggest supermarket agreed to buy Argos-owner Home Retail for 1.3 billion pounds ($1.9 billion) to boost its online business and expand sales of items such as electrical goods. Sainsbury’s said it expected the offer to boost its earnings per share in the first full year following completion.

397,2017-06-12,2017,6.0,12,Jarrett Renshaw,BP violated contract when it blended Texas crude: Monroe Energy,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BP PLC violated its supply contract when it sold oil to refiner Monroe Energy that was a blend of lower-valued Texas crude with premium varieties, Monroe alleged in a federal court filing last week. Monroe Energy, a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines that owns a 185,000 barrel-per-day refinery outside of Philadelphia, said the blending of lower quality crudes is prohibited under the supply contract. The company asked a U.S. District Court judge in New York on June 7 to dismiss BP’s April lawsuit alleging Monroe wrongfully severed the deal. The motion for dismissal has not been previously reported. BP was allowed to blend Eagle Ford crudes from different wells under its contract but only if each blend met specific API gravity and vapor pressure requirements. Blending lower-grade crude is an industry tactic used to boost returns on less desirable oil, said Monroe, which filed a motion to have the suit dismissed. BP said in its initial complaint that it blended batches of crude out of Texas’s Eagle Ford shale play prior to delivery. The company said the two parties specifically discussed such blending before a three-year deal was signed in 2014. Monroe unilaterally ended the deal in June 2016. “Monroe Energy has breached the contract for delivered crude product in an apparent attempt to avoid paying the agreed-upon price for the crude BP supplies,” BP said in a written statement on Monday, adding that Monroe had accepted the product without complaint.  Monroe declined comment on Monday.

398,2019-03-25,2019,3.0,25,"Devika  Krishna Kumar, Jessica Resnick-Ault","U.S. buyers of Venezuelan oil sub in Shell, BP offshore crude","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry have made winners out of Gulf of Mexico offshore heavyweights Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc as U.S. refiners in need of substitutes are scooping up oil produced in the region. The two major oil companies produce notable amounts of crude oil that refiners have settled on as the immediate replacement for the heavy Venezuelan crude that U.S. refiners relied on for years. Trading volumes in these grades of oil have surged to the highest in months, and prices touched five-year peaks since U.S. sanctions were imposed late in January. U.S. production has surged to a record 12 million barrels per day, but less than 5 percent of that is heavy oil. The sanctions have hamstrung refineries in the United States, as many giant Gulf Coast facilities need heavier oil to produce high-margin refined products like diesel and jet fuel. Heavy crude accounts for nearly two-thirds of U.S. oil imports. Of that, Venezuela’s oil accounted for 10 percent of heavy crude imports in 2018 and about 13 percent in 2017, according to U.S. Energy Department figures. Offshore Gulf oil prices - mostly Mars crude , considered the benchmark U.S. sour crude grade - have hit five-year highs, and sales are up sharply, according to company executives, market participants and data reviewed by Reuters. “We’re buying more Mars for the current time,” said Marathon Petroleum Corp Chief Executive Gary Heminger. Marathon, one of the nation’s largest refiners, was not a major importer of Venezuelan crude. “Since we’re exporting so much in the light sweet crude markets, you’re going to have to bring in more medium sours.” Shell operates the most Gulf platforms and BP has the highest volume of output from the region, according to figures provided by the companies. Representatives from the companies would not explicitly link the recent boost in sales of offshore crude to Venezuela’s sanctions, though they did acknowledge the market’s interest. “We do understand that Mars crude is perceived well in the market right now. We’re happy for that and we take advantage of that,” said Rick Tallant, Shell’s vice president of deepwater Gulf of Mexico production. Production in the Gulf of Mexico rose to a record 1.7 million bpd in 2018, and is expected to exceed 2 million bpd in the fourth quarter, according to U.S. Energy Department figures. Sanctions have intensified the need for the oil that is being pumped out of these vast fields. Gulf production averaged 1.89 million bpd in March, up nearly 145,000 bpd from February, said Jodi Quinnell, oil analyst at Genscape. Graphic: U.S. buyers of Venezuelan oil sub in offshore crude - tmsnrt.rs/2HE1rTc Mars generally refers to a medium sour grade of oil produced from the Mars platform, a joint venture between majority owner Shell and BP, located about 130 miles (210 km) off the coast of New Orleans. Refiners, including Valero Energy Corp and Marathon, have been scooping up Mars from Shell’s trading unit in the weeks following the sanctions, sources familiar with the deals said. Other refiners, such as Phillips 66, were also seen buying Southern Green Canyon crude (SGC), a grade similar to Mars, from Shell. Trading in those grades has surged. Volumes in the Argus Sour Crude Index (ASCI), a tool reflecting prices of three U.S. deepwater sour crudes including Mars, rose to 614,036 contracts for February, the most in nearly a year, data from price reporting agency Argus Media show. Volumes in Mars for February delivery rose to 410,536 contracts, the highest since August 2018, the data showed. Prices of other offshore grades such as Thunder Horse, Bonito and SGC also surged to the highest in five years after sanctions took effect. Phillips 66 declined to comment and Valero did not respond to requests for comment. In an auction of federal offshore leases last week, Shell submitted the most high bids for Gulf leases, winning 87 tracts of land valued at more than $84 million. BP grabbed the third-most parcels, winning 23 parcels priced at more than $15 million. Shell’s pipeline partnership, Shell Midstream Partners, shipped 10 percent more crude on the Mars system to the Gulf Coast last year. Both Shell’s Tallant and BP’s regional president for the Gulf of Mexico and Canada Starlee Sykes said their companies were continuing to actively invest in the Gulf, where they say crude can be produced at levels that were cost-competitive with that from onshore shale formations. With several new projects slated to come online as soon as this year, U.S. refiners could replace a good deal of heavy and medium-crude imports with Gulf barrels, said Sandy Fielden, director of commodities & energy research at Morningstar. “Because of their proximity and ease of access to this market, Gulf producers have a natural advantage selling new output to Gulf Coast refiners,” he said.

403,2017-12-13,2017,12.0,13,,Australian watchdog blocks BP buy of Woolworths petrol stations,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia’s antitrust regulator on Thursday blocked BP Plc’s (BP.L) A$1.8 billion ($1.4 billion) purchase of Woolworths Ltd’s (WOW.AX) petrol stations, even after the oil company offered to sell some stations to ease competition concerns. BP and Woolworths, which wants to exit the business to focus on its supermarkets, said they were disappointed by the decision after months of talks with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and were reviewing what to do next. Decisions by the commission can be challenged in court. “We remain confident that, with appropriate divestments as offered by BP, this transaction would not substantially lessen competition,” BP Australia President Andy Holmes said in a statement. “In light of this, we are currently consulting with our lawyers to determine our next steps.” Woolworths shares initially fell 1.4 percent after the announcement but recovered to trade down 0.7 percent in a broader market that was up slightly. While the asset sale was blocked, its petrol retail revenue stream remains unaffected. Investors said the rejection was not a total surprise, given the regulator had flagged concerns about the deal earlier this year. The acquisition was announced in December 2016. “I don’t think it’s significant for Woolworths,” said Stephen Bruce, a portfolio manager at Perennial Value Management, an investor in Woolworths. The main issue for Woolworths is that following any sale of its petrol stations it wants its supermarket shoppers to continue to receive fuel discounts from the new owner, which the regulator cleared separately on Thursday. The blocked acquisition boosted BP rival Caltex Australia Ltd (CTX.AX), which stood to lose a major fuel supply contract with Woolworths that it said previously would have cost it up to A$150 million in lost earnings before interest and tax, or 15 percent of its forecast earnings for 2017. Caltex shares rose as much as 5.2 percent. The company said on Thursday it would continue to supply Woolworths. The competition watchdog said BP’s acquisition would likely lead to higher fuel prices, highlighting that BP’s prices on average were sharply higher than Woolworths in Australia’s big cities. It said BP tended to raise fuel prices faster than Woolworths and lower them more slowly in response to oil price changes. If Woolworths were no longer a competitor on pricing, it added, all remaining players would raise their fuel prices. “The bottom line is that we consider motorists will end up paying more, regardless of where they buy fuel, if this acquisition goes ahead,” ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement.

I think there are some planned for 2019,” Gary Jones, BP’s head for Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, said. He said the company would use different ways to conduct inspections, including the use of drones, to minimize the need for any shutdown. BP operates the giant Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) oilfields in Azerbaijan as well as the Shah Deniz gas fields. The company said on Friday ACG oil output in 2017 edged down to 588,000 barrels per day (bpd) from 630,000 bpd the year before. Natural gas production from the Shah Deniz offshore fields was 10.2 billion cubic meters (bcm) and condensate output came to 2.4 million tonnes, down from 10.7 bcm of gas and 2.5 million tonnes of condensate in 2016. Jones declined to specify oil and gas output projections for this year, but said BP was trying to reduce declines in oil production to a minimum. “Globally we are trying to keep (oil output) declines in a range of 2.5-5 percent per year.” BP and Azerbaijan last year extended to 2050 the agreement to develop the ACG, a deal dubbed “the contract of the century” when first signed in 1994. The arrangement was initially due to run until 2024. Jones said the Southern Gas Corridor, a project of pipelines to bring gas from Azerbaijan to Europe, “was running ahead of schedule and ahead of budget”. He said BP would continue investment in ongoing projects as well as new ones. In 2018, the company plans to explore three prospective areas in shallow waters off the Absheron peninsula, as well as engineering investment for the Central-Eastern Azeri platform, and seismic work on block D-230. “We hope to sign a production-sharing agreement with SOCAR on D-230 block this year, very soon,” Jones said, referring to the Azeri state energy company. He added that drilling a first exploration well on the Shafag-Asiman block was planned for 2019.

406,2016-09-30 00:00:00,2016,9.0,30,,BP decries Deepwater Horizon film as inaccurate,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP has criticized the new “Deepwater Horizon” film as being an inaccurate Hollywood dramatization of the deadly oil rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. “The Deepwater Horizon movie is Hollywood’s take on a tragic and complex accident. It is not an accurate portrayal of the events that led to the accident, our people, or the character of our company,” Geoff Morrell, BP senior vice-president of U.S. communications & external affairs, said in a statement on the British oil and gas company’s website. “Deepwater Horizon,” which is released in the United States on Friday, focuses on the hours before and after the explosion from a well blowout on the BP rig in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010, leading to the worst offshore oil disaster in U.S. history. Eleven workers were killed and millions of barrels of oil spewed onto the shorelines of several states for nearly three months. BP, which has had to pay over $55 billion in clean-up costs and fines, said the film “ignores the conclusions reached by every official investigation: that the accident was the result of multiple errors made by a number of companies.” Actor Mark Wahlberg, who plays an oil engineer who survived the disaster, said the film aimed to honor the 11 men killed in the accident. Other than BP, rig operator Transocean and services contractor Halliburton were also found to be at fault . “Coming as it does six-and-a-half years after the accident, the movie also does not reflect who we are today, the lengths we’ve gone to restore the Gulf, the work we’ve done to become safer, and the trust we’ve earned back around the world.” BP said in the statement.

The FTSE 100 jumped 0.8 percent, starting the month on a firm footing, while mid-caps rose 0.4 percent. Blue-chips were little changed after a survey showed a boom in exports helped UK manufacturing growth recover in July. Oil major BP was the biggest contributor to large-cap gains, adding 12 points to the index as its shares jumped 3 percent after beating profit expectations for the second quarter. “BP’s 37 percent beat versus consensus (3 percent versus UBS estimates) was driven by a very strong result in the Upstream, part offset by weaker earnings in the Downstream,” said UBS analysts. “BP had pre-announced the $750 million exploration write-off related to Angola but the remaining charge was lighter than forecast,” they added. Tobacco stocks BAT and Imperial Brands enjoyed a slight recovery, rising 1.6 and 1.4 percent respectively after sharp losses the two previous sessions as investors digested a U.S. regulatory clampdown on the amount of nicotine in cigarette products. Although BP kept its dividend flat at 10 cents per share, some investors fretted about possible threats to the British market’s strong dividend yield. “What happens if tobacco profits are regulated to a fraction of their current levels and the oil companies have to ramp up their investment into renewables?” mused Jim Wood-Smith, head of research at Hawksmoor Investment Management. “None of this may happen, but for those relying on investment income, it is a kick up the backside that it must be properly diversified. Cuts in tobacco and oil dividends may well come and we have all been warned,” he added. Shares in engine maker Rolls Royce climbed 7.5 percent after a solid first half which saw profits rise more than expected as it delivered a 27 percent increase in large civil aerospace engines. Testing firm Intertek jumped 8.6 percent after reporting a 21.9 percent rise in first-half profit, helped by the fall in sterling. Earnings from Centrica sent the stock up 2.1 percent, with Britain’s largest energy supplier announcing an increase to its electricity prices despite losing another 485,000 customers since May. Insurers also contributed to gains, with shares in Direct Line, Britain’s largest motor insurer, up 6.5 percent after the firm reported a 9.5 percent rise in first-half profit, helped by strength in auto insurance premiums. Peer Admiral, which reports earnings on Aug. 16, also gained 2.9 percent. Fresnillo was the worst-performing of just a handful of fallers, down 1.6 percent despite reporting a doubling of profit for the first half. Analysts at Shore Capital pointed to a strong balance sheet but a “relatively paltry” interim dividend. “Stronger second half should see a more generous final dividend, we think,” they wrote in a note. Mid-cap lender CYBG gained 7.1 percent after confirming its full-year targets, and saying costs for the full year would be at least 10 million pounds lower than previously thought. “Overall this is a good quarter for CYBG but we continue to expect that margins will remain under pressure with Standard Variable Rates amongst the highest in the sector,” said KBW analysts. Shares in hedge fund Man Group climbed 4.4 percent, putting the stock among the best-performing in Europe, after assets under management rose 19 percent in the first half.

410,2017-06-15,2017,6.0,15,"Dmitry Zhdannikov, Ron Bousso",BP's Dudley seen reigning for years to restore major's might,"LONDON (Reuters) - When BP boss Bob Dudley clinched a final deal to settle litigation over the deadly Deepwater Horizon disaster, many oil industry executives and investors thought his mission was accomplished. But now, two years later, the 61-year-old is showing no sign of easing into retirement. In fact he plans to oversee an ambitious expansion plan and stay at the helm of the British oil major until at least the end of the decade, according to sources familiar with the matter. The American CEO has told his leadership team that it is in his family’s tradition to not retire until 65 - which would take him to 2020 - and that he could perhaps work even longer than that, the sources said. In another signal that there is unlikely to be a change at the top anytime soon, there has been no imminent succession planning at the firm, according to the sources, one of who said succession was “not a live project”. When Dudley finally decides to go, there will no shortage of candidates to take his place, however. BP’s chief financial officer, British national Brian Gilvary, 55 and the head of upstream, Irishman Bernard Looney, 46, have been cited as possible successors. There has been persistent industry speculation about when Dudley will call time on his BP career since he struck the 2015 settlement deal under which the company agreed to pay out a total of about $60 billion over the disaster that left 11 dead and led to the largest oil spill in U.S. history. He had been made CEO in 2010 - the first American to lead BP in its 108-year-old history - to steer the company through the swathe of U.S. litigation, and the deal represented a milestone. But rather than stepping back from the fray, he has since embarked on the biggest expansion plan in a generation for BP, even in the face of a collapse in oil prices. The company has become the fastest-growing oil major in the world. It will launch seven oil and gas fields this year - more than any other year in its history - and will launch nine more before the end of the decade, adding 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil and gas to its production. By 2020 the company, including its stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft, will be producing as much as 4 million bpd - the same as before the Deepwater Horizon spill and up from the 3 million bpd it was producing after offloading assets to cover the litigation costs. “We are firing on all cylinders,” Dudley told a shareholders meeting in May as he aims to catch up with production volumes of its biggest rivals Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell. Whether this strategy will prove effective in the long-term is by no means certain; BP’s large liabilities linked to Deepwater Horizon mean it requires a significantly higher oil price - than the present price and compared with rivals - to pay for its operations and dividends. A sluggish recovery in oil prices could also lead to its already high debt rising further. Rating agency Moody’s upgraded BP’s credit rating last week for the first time in 19 years while, in another sign of confidence, 97 percent of BP shareholders voted to approve Dudley’s new pay package last month. “Bob hasn’t done anything that we wouldn’t agree with so far. When times are hard and bad, I would want someone who is pretty sensible and conservative,” said Rohan Murphy from Allianz, which holds BP shares. “Dudley is a safe pair of hands. He won’t do anything too maverick,” Murphy added. “The recent rating upgrade shows the story hangs together.” The calm and softly spoken Dudley was stress-tested more than once before getting the top job. His career included three punishing years fighting a corporate war with Russian oligarchs at the firm’s giant Russian venture TNK-BP that forced him to flee the country and go into hiding. He became BP chief executive when his predecessor Tony Hayward’s tenure ended abruptly following the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon platform in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Dudley was given a task of steadying the ship as BP struggled with a firestorm from the U.S. government, victims of the spill, environmental groups and shareholders. Over the next five years, the company shed more than $55 billion worth of oil fields, refineries and infrastructure to pay for the spill clean-up. BP was abandoning low-margin projects and mature markets like Venezuela or Vietnam, often getting top dollar for its sales as oil prices hovered above $100 per barrel. In retrospect, BP had unknowingly stolen a march on most of its rivals who had to embark on similar asset sales much later when crude prices began to collapse in 2014. Just as BP was slowly emerging from the spill fallout, the collapse in oil prices drove it to its biggest loss ever in 2016. Like its peers, BP responded by slashing thousands of jobs and tightening budgets. The efforts bore fruit. In the first quarter of 2017, its profits tripled and its production rose to a five-year high thanks to higher production. Dudley’s team argues that this will only improve over time as the company’s strategic change of tack means it is producing more profitable oil and gas from a smaller number of fields. Another metric investors are also closely watching is BP’s debt, standing at $38.6 billion, or 28 percent of its total equity including debt - the highest figure among oil majors. That ratio is set to improve as Deepwater Horizon cash payments decline over the coming years. They amounted to about $7 billion in 2016 and $4.5 billion in 2017 but will fall to $1-$2 billion from 2018. BP can currently balance its books only at $60 per barrel, compared to $50 for most of its rivals, but that figure should also fall as Deepwater Horizon payments decline. “Bob Dudley is building something that could be very interesting in the future ... he just gets on with business and that’s what investors want,” said James Laing, equities fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, which holds BP shares. “The dividend is still sustainable, debt levels are high but will come down, the cash breakeven has been lowered, the resource base is still increasing,” he added. “It doesn’t feel like there is a lot of criticism to be made.” Writing by Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Pravin Char",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bp-ceo-idUSKBN19614U,Business News,Reuters

412,2016-12-05,2016,12.0,5,Jessica Resnick-Ault,BP's Mad Dog leads the oil pack's return to the Gulf of Mexico,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BP Plc’s decision to move ahead with a $9 billion project to drill in the Gulf of Mexico is the first step toward major oil companies moving forward with U.S. offshore plans postponed during crude’s price rout. Exploration and development of new wells in the Gulf slowed as crude prices cratered from over $100 a barrel in 2014 to a low of $26.05 early this year. The project, known as Mad Dog Phase 2, is the first new Gulf platform to be sanctioned in a year and a half, since rival oil major Royal Dutch Shell Plc proceeded with development of its Appatomattox project in July, 2015. BP’s decision on the platform and infrastructure, announced on Thursday, came after the oil major managed to cut projected costs for the project by more than 50 percent, BP said. Mad Dog, which will have the capacity to pump up to 140,000 barrels per day (bpd), has access to a proven crude supply and the drilling will be completed in an area that requires less technical complexity than some of the deepwater fields where competitors have proposed projects. It is slated to start producing oil in late 2021. “They were able to reduce their capital expenditures, the fields that they pick happen to have the right DNA, and this is exceptional DNA,” said Nansen Saleri, chief executive office of Quantum Reservoir Impact, and a former head of reservoir management for state oil company Saudi Aramco. “When you’re talking about 10,000 barrels per day, that’s Middle East standards.” The return to U.S. deepwater is likely to be slow, Saleri said, as oil prices still are not high enough for a rush back into the Gulf. Full reentry into the Gulf will require sustained benchmark oil prices above $60 a barrel, far above the near $50 currently trading, he said. BP is returning to expansion in the Gulf after a painful hiatus following the 2010 explosion at its Macondo well, which led to the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history. BP has had to pay over $55 billion in claims and costs associated with the spill. The company maintained an active interest in the region in the meantime, bidding for rights to develop territory that came up for auction in the interim and working to drive down costs of projects kept on hold. The U.S. Gulf, once prized for its abundant resources and lower political risk than alternatives such as West Africa, fell out of favor as technology unlocked cheaper production from U.S. shale fields onshore, creating a glut of production that could be more easily increased or throttled back in response to price fluctuations. The Gulf produced 1.5 million bpd of oil in September, the latest month for which data is available, compared with a high of 1.7 million bpd in 2009, before shale’s popularity grew. “Some people say that deepwater is finished. Well, as you can see from this, we have a very different view. Based on our current calculations Mad Dog will break even around the $40 per barrel mark,” Bernard Looney, BP’s chief executive of upstream, told investors in June. While producers have sanctioned relatively small $300 million to $400 million projects, known as tie-backs, no standalone projects have been approved since Shell’s Appatomattox. Other U.S. drillers including Anadarko Petroleum Corp and Cobalt International Energy have platforms under review in the Gulf, and Chevron Corp’s Anchor project is also being appraised. BP may have the edge on competitors because Mad Dog is locked in Mycocene-era geological formations, according to Wood Mackenzie. Those formations do not require the same level of high-pressure, high-temperature drilling that Anadarko and Cobalt’s platforms targeting oil in Lower Tertiary rock formations may require. “At the end of the day, these large companies need large projects, and deepwater is going to be where they are going to find these large projects to move their needle,” said Imran Khan, research manager at Wood Mackenzie.

BP slid 7 percent after underlying replacement cost profit came in at $196 million, significantly lower than analysts’ expectations of $730 million. BP’s results were worse even than when it counted the costs of the deadly Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010, raising questions over the sustainability of its dividend. “This morning’s results from BP have added to the gloom surrounding the sector,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, in a note. “While the dividend has been maintained the question now is whether it will continue to be so given that energy prices still show no signs of finding a base.” BP has been hit by a slump in oil prices to multi-year lows in 2016, and oil was on the back foot again on Tuesday. Concerns over demand from China and oversupply sent Brent crude prices down over 1 percent, while FTSE 350 Oil and Gas stocks fell 3.7 percent, the biggest sectoral faller. In all, the FTSE 100 was down 1.3 percent at 5,980.16 points by 0843 GMT, with energy stocks taking 28 points off the index.

417,2017-11-07,2017,11.0,7,Dmitry Zhdannikov,BP joins Shell in helping Mexico execute oil hedge: sources,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP (BP.L) helped Mexico execute its 2018 oil hedge, the biggest in the industry, becoming the second major after Shell to participate in the highly coveted program and challenging the traditional role of banks in the operation. Three industry sources said BP has become a participant of the 2018 program on which Mexico spent some $1.26 billion to hedge its 2018 oil exports against oil price falls as part of government’s efforts to stabilize its budget. BP declined to comment. BP joins rival Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), which made a first foray last year to become the first major to challenge years of dominance of big Wall Street banks in the program. Shell declined to comment. Banks such as Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Citi (C.N) and JPMorgan (JPM.N) have dominated Mexico’s program for years but their role has diminished with tighter regulations on bank commodity trading, including a near total ban on proprietary trading. Commodities-related revenue across Wall Street banks broadly tumbled in the first half of 2017 to its lowest level since at least 2006, consultancy Coalition said in a report. This was due mainly to a drop in client activity and a slump in trading performance in the energy sector. Mexico did not disclose the volumes of oil hedged nor detail of the average price per barrel of put options that the government has purchased. In September, the finance ministry proposed a 2018 budget that based expected oil export revenue on an estimate of $46 per barrel. In October, members of Congress increased that estimate to $48.5 per barrel as global oil prices rose. On Tuesday, Brent oil prices stood at $64 per barrel. For more than a decade, Mexico’s government has paid for a hedge every year in a bid to guarantee its revenues from oil exports by state company Pemex. The program is seen as the world’s top sovereign derivatives trade. Last year, the government bought put options at an average price of $38 per barrel to cover 250 million barrels of crude at a cost of $1.03 billion and underpin the 2017 budget, which was based on an average price of $42 per barrel. This year, Mexico is on track to not see any income from its oil hedge as prices for Mexican crude trade well above $50 per barrel. In 2016, Mexico saw a $2.65 billion payout from its oil hedge. Mexico used to receive about one-third of federal revenues from oil sales, but it now funds less than one-fifth of the budget with oil sales after the collapse of crude prices in late 2014 and a decline in production.

418,2017-05-01,2017,5.0,1,Margarita Antidze,BP says Caspian gas pipeline's Georgia section ready by mid-2018,"TBILISI (Reuters) - BP plans to complete by mid-2018 the Georgian section of a $40-billion strategic pipeline bringing Caspian gas from Azerbaijan into Europe, the British energy company’s country manager for Georgia said. The so-called southern gas corridor, which is meant to reduce the European Union’s dependence on Russian energy, will start at Azerbaijan’s Shah Deniz II gas field and cross through Georgia, Turkey, Greece, Albania and Italy. It is the largest attempt so far to bring new supply sources to Europe. Around 10 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year of Azeri gas should reach Europe by 2020 through the Trans Adriatic Pipeline, with another 6 bcm destined for Georgia through the South Caucasus Pipeline and Turkey through the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline. “All of the project’s components are ... on schedule as far as their intended delivery day for when commercial operations are due to begin in the middle to the later part of the next year,” Chris Schlueter told Reuters, referring to the Georgian section. The Georgian part of the project includes the construction of two compressor stations, a 65-km pipeline and a metering station near the Turkish border. Schlueter said work on the pipeline had finished, with one compressor station 95 percent ready and the other compressor station 55 percent complete. Construction of the metering station was under way, he said, without giving specifics. “Later this year we’ll start to introduce the gas to the pipeline in order to get it ready for operations,” he said. Schlueter said the project’s capital expenditure in 2016 was $550 million. In the first quarter of this year the figure was around $100 million, slightly less than in the same quarter of 2016. “Peak spending was last year and we will start to slow down (in terms of investment) this year,” he said. Schlueter said peak production from the Shah Deniz II field was expected to occur several years after 2020.

Shareholders at BP’s annual general meeting also approved a new remuneration policy that will lower performance incentives. With the vast majority of votes counted, shareholders adopted BP’s 2016 pay by a majority of 97.09 percent, the highest in at least 10 years, and the new pay policy by a majority of 97.32 percent. Last year, around 60 percent of shareholders opposed BP’s pay policy after a record loss amid a sharp slump in oil prices. “At our meeting last year, you, our shareholders, sent us a very clear message on how we approached paying our executive directors,” BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said. BP’s pay policy changes, which will apply for the coming three years, include lowering Dudley’s maximum long-term payout to five times salary, from seven times, and cutting bonus payments by a quarter. Dudley’s 2016 pay was some 40 percent lower than the previous year and was a result of “downward discretion” to the four components of his total pay, the company said. But even after a cut of nearly $8 million, Dudley’s pay remains well above that of rival European oil companies. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) CEO Ben van Beurden was awarded an 8.263 million euro ($8.8 million) pay package for 2016, while Total’s (TOTF.PA) Patrick Pouyanne’s was 3.8 million euros. Dudley told the AGM that BP was one of the fastest growing oil and gas companies in the world as it prepares to launch new projects that will boost production by 800,0000 barrels per day by 2020. By the end of the decade, Dudley expects BP to produce as much as oil and gas as before the 2010 U.S. Gulf of Mexico spill, which forced it to sell a third of its assets to cover litigation costs.

The European Commission failed to prove that the Belgian tax break constituted aid, said the ruling by the General Court, the lower branch of the Court of Justice in Luxembourg. “The Commission wrongly considered that the Belgian system relating to the excess profit of multinational companies constituted an aid scheme,” it said. The ruling marks a setback for the EU’s crackdown on tax avoidance by multinationals, a drive led by Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager. The European Commission in 2016 had ordered Belgium to recover some 700 million euros ($789 million) from companies which benefited from the scheme. In addition to BP and BASF, Wabco, Cellio, Atlas Copco and Belgacom (now Proximus) benefited from the tax break. Belgium and U.S. manufacturer Magnetrol had challenged the Commission in cases filed with the General Court. It’s possible that the Commission will now pursue individual cases in the Belgian tax break case, according to one lawyer. “The Commission can take a new decision qualifying each individual case,” said Jacques Derenne, a partner at law firm Sheppard Mullin. Elsewhere the European Commission’s crackdown on large companies avoiding tax has seen it order Ireland to recover some 13 billion euros from iPhone maker Apple. Luxembourg was instructed to claw back 250 million euros from Amazon, about 120 million euros from France’s Engie and up to 30 million euros from Fiat Chrysler.

426,2018-08-27,2018,8.0,27,,Total rules out investing in U.S. shale oil after BP-BHP deal,"STAVANGER, Norway (Reuters) - French energy group Total (TOTF.PA) is not looking at investing in the U.S. shale oil industry, the company’s chief executive said on Monday. Patrick Pouyanne made the comment when asked whether peer BP’s (BP.L) $10.5 billion acquisition of U.S. shale assets from BHP Billiton BLT.L(BHP.AX) had made the sector more attractive. “It’s first quite expensive, second we don’t have the human resources. BP had the human resources, BP had already a position, so I can understand their move but it’s not my case,” Pouyanne said on the sidelines of an oil conference. BP’s acquisition of about 500,000 producing acres marked a turning point for the group since the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, for which the company is still paying off more than $65 billion in penalties and clean-up costs. Shell (RDSa.L) and Norway’s Equinor (EQNR.OL) have also invested in U.S. shale, but Eni (ENI.MI) and Total have been cautious. U.S. shale veteran and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD.N) Chairman Scott Sheffield rang an optimistic note when asked at the conference about European oil and gas companies investing in U.S. shale. “Eventually I think more and more majors will get there, (because) it’s the fastest-growing region for the next 10 years in the world.

432,2018-01-31,2018,1.0,31,Ron Bousso,BP makes two discoveries in UK North Sea,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP has made two new oil and gas discoveries in the UK North Sea, it said on Wednesday, giving new impetus to its plans to boost production in the ageing basin into the middle of the century. The new discoveries are also the latest bright spot for the North Sea after a number of large new fields started up in recent years, helping to reverse a long and gradual decline in output since the late 1990s. “These are exciting times for BP in the North Sea as we lay the foundations of a refreshed and revitalized business that we expect to double production to 200,000 barrels a day by 2020 and keep producing beyond 2050,” Mark Thomas, BP North Sea regional president, said. London-based BP said it had made one discovery in Block 29/4e in the central North Sea, named Capercaillie, and another in Block 206/9b west of Shetland, branded Achmelvich. Both wells were drilled by the Paul B Loyd Junior rig in summer 2017. The size of the resource was not disclosed. The discoveries will help boost production from BP’s recently-launched Quad 204 field in the West Shetlands as well as the Clair Ridge field, which is due to come into production this year, Thomas said. With seven field start-ups in 2017, and five set to start in 2018, BP plans to boost its production by 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) by 2020, which will be mostly gas. It produced around 3.5 million bpd last year. The company will nevertheless not change its spending plans because of rising global oil prices and is preparing to approve projects this year that can make money with prices below $40 a barrel, the head of its oil and gas division Bernard Looney told Reuters on Tuesday. And as oil prices recover to around $70 a barrel after a three-year downturn, so is activity in the North Sea. “The UK offshore oil and gas industry is stirring back to life, fueled by a robust uptick in the number of field development projects,” Oslo-based consultancy Rystad Energy said. Up to 13 fields in the UK North Sea are expected to get the go-ahead for development in 2018, compared with only four in the past two years, Rystad said. BP is 100 percent owner of Capercaillie while the Achmelvich well is operated by BP, with a 52.6 percent stake, together with Royal Dutch Shell, 28 percent, and Chevron, 19.4 percent, BP said in a statement. The Capercaillie well was drilled to a total depth of 3,750 meters and encountered light oil and gas-condensate in Paleocene and Cretaceous-age reservoirs. The well data is currently under evaluation. Options are expected to be considered for a possible tie-back development to existing infrastructure. The Achmelvich well was drilled to a total depth of 2,395 meters and encountered oil in Mesozoic-age reservoirs. Evaluation and interpretation of the well results is ongoing to assess future options.

433,2018-02-20,2018,2.0,20,Ron Bousso,BP sees self-driving electric vehicles crimping oil demand by 2040,"LONDON (Reuters) - The emergence of self-driving electric cars and travel sharing are set to dent oil consumption by 2040, oil and gas giant BP (BP.L) said, forecasting a peak in demand for the first time. In its benchmark annual Energy Outlook, BP forecast a 100-fold growth in electric vehicles by 2040, with its chief economist Spencer Dale painting a world in which we travel much more but instead of using private cars, we increasingly share trips in autonomous vehicles. While travel demand more than doubles over the period as economies in countries such as China and India grow, higher oil demand will be more than offset by increased engine efficiency standards as well as the larger number of EVs and shared traveling. Unlike many other forecasts, including previous BP Energy Outlooks, which looked solely at the growing share of EVs in the car fleet, BP this year focused on the share of vehicles kilometers powered by electricity. Under BP’s Evolving Transition scenario, which assumes that policies and technology continue to evolve at a speed similar to that seen in the recent past, some 30 percent of car kilometers are powered by electricity by 2040 from almost zero in 2016. At the same time, the number of EVs is set to increase from 3 million today to over 320 million by 2040, representing roughly 15 percent out of a total car fleet of 2 billion. The gap between the increasing number of EVs on the road and the kilometers powered by electricity is due to the expected growth in so-called shared mobility by EVs, Dale said. “Cars will be used much more intensely over time,” Dale told reporters in a briefing on Monday ahead of the release of the report on Tuesday. As a result, fuel demand from the car fleet is forecast to dip to 18.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2040 from 18.7 million bpd in 2016, when it represented around one fifth of total oil demand, according to BP. BP expects autonomous vehicles to become available in the early 2020s. Their initial high cost means the vast majority of the cars will be bought by fleets offering shared mobility services. The average electric car is expected to be driven about two and a half times more than an internal combustion car, according to Dale. “What we expect to see in the 2030s is a huge growth in shared mobility autonomous cars ... Once you don’t have to pay for a driver, the cost of taking one of those share mobility fleets services will fall by about 40 or 50 percent,” Dale said. The vast majority of the shared mobility is expected to be EVs because of their lower maintenance costs. Car makers including General Motors (GM.N) and high-tech giants such as Google Waymo and Uber Technologies have poured billions into the autonomous vehicles industry hoping gain a first-mover advantage. Robo-taxi services are seen as the main use for most self-driving vehicles. BP sharply raised its estimate of growth in electric vehicles in the coming decades from last year’s forecast that EVs would reach 100 million by 2035. The big upwards revision is due to an increase in hybrid cars and an expected sharp growth in EV purchases in the second half of the 2030s, Dale said. London-based BP joined other oil companies such as Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) in forecasting a peak for oil demand in the late 2030s, when it is expected to slightly decline at around 110 million bpd. It did not foresee a peak in demand in its previous outlooks that stretched into 2035. While the transportation sector will continue to dominate the growth in oil consumption, demand for plastic manufacturing will become the main source of growth in the 2030s. Oil companies such as BP, Shell and France’s Total (TOTF.PA) are betting on growing demand from the petrochemical sector in the coming decades. Dale however said changes in regulations for plastics consumption such as stringent policies on plastic bags and packaging could dent oil demand by as much as 2 million bpd, roughly the same as the impact of EVs. Overall energy demand will continue to grow in the coming decades, rising by a third into 2040, or roughly 1.3 percent per year, driven by growth in China and India, but the world is learning to “do more with less energy” as economies become more efficient, Dale said. For example, the European Union’s gross domestic product is set to treble in 2040 from 1975 but the level of energy demand will be the same. China’s energy demand will continue to grow but at a slower pace by the 2030s, when India will become the main driver of growth. BP once again revised upwards its forecast for growth in renewable power, which is set to grow by 40 percent by 2040, with its share in the energy mix increasing from 4 percent to 14 percent. The revision is due to technological gains as well as more aggressive government policies, particularly in India and China. “There is plenty of scope for policy to continue to surprise us” to further boost the growth in the renewables, Dale said.

435,2016-01-12,2016,1.0,12,,BP to slash thousands more jobs in face of oil downturn,"British oil and gas company BP announced plans on Tuesday to slash 5 percent of its global workforce in the face of a continued slump in oil prices. It said it aims to reduce its global oil production, or upstream, headcount by 4,000 to 20,000 as it undergoes a $3.5 billion restructuring programme. BP said its headcount totalled around 80,000 at the end of 2015. With crude oil prices at 12-year lows of around $32 a barrel, the world's biggest oil and gas producers are set to continue aggressively slashing spending this year as they face their longest period of investment cuts in decades. ""We want to simplify (our) structure and reduce costs without compromising safety. Globally, we expect the headcount in upstream to be below 20,000 by the end of the year,"" a company spokesman said. In the North Sea, he said BP planned to reduce headcount by 600 people over the next two years with most cuts likely in 2016. BP shares, which have fallen by around 40 percent since the oil price began to slide in mid-2014, were up 1.2 percent at 1157 GMT compared with a 0.8 percent rise for the broader sector index. Oil companies including Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron have already slashed tens of thousands jobs globally to deal with a near 75 percent drop in oil prices since June 2014 that has seen earnings collapse. BP, which must also pay $20 billion in fines to resolve the deadly 2010 Gulf of Mexico spill, announced in October plans for a third round of spending cuts and said it would limit capital spending, or capex, to $17-19 billion a year through to 2017. The company, which has already sold over $50 billion of assets in recent years in order to cover the spill costs, said it expected an additional $3-5 billion of divestments in 2016. Fourth-quarter upstream earnings for oil majors are expected to fall by 84 percent from a year earlier and 48 percent from the previous quarter, according to analysts at Macquarie. BP will report fourth quarter and full-year results for 2015 on Feb. 2.

438,2016-02-02,2016,2.0,2,,BP reports worst annual loss in 20 years,"Oil giant BP reported its worst annual loss in 20 years and further restructuring charges as low oil prices continue to weigh on the company. For 2015 as a whole, the company reported a loss of $6.5 billion. The stock opened down over 5 percent in London trade. On an underlying basis, fourth quarter replacement cost profit came in at $196 million, well below expectations of $730 million in a poll of analysts provided by the company, and down from $2.2 billion a year earlier. Replacement cost profit is a common accounting measure to report profits in the oil industry which takes into account the fluctuations in the price of oil. Oil prices are wallowing around a 12-year low of around $33 a barrel for benchmark Brent crude as demand fails to keep pace with a glut in global supply. BP took $2.6 billion in non-operating post-tax charges in the fourth quarter, primarily related to impairments of upstream assets as well as restructuring charges for the group. Including these charges and other offsetting effects, BP reported a replacement cost loss for the fourth quarter of 2015 of $2.2 billion. Cumulative restructuring charges from the beginning of the fourth quarter 2014 totaled $1.5 billion by the end of 2015. A further $1.0 billion of restructuring charges are expected to be incurred in 2016, the group said. Still, it reported a quarterly dividend of 10 cents per ordinary share. In its earnings statement, BP said that ""despite strong operational performance and growing cost reductions, the lower underlying result was predominantly driven by the impact of steeply lower oil and gas prices on BP's Upstream segment, which reported a pre-tax loss for the quarter. This was partially offset by a strong set of counter-cyclical results from the Downstream segment,"" it said. Times were tough for the company when oil dropped to $60 a barrel last year and have only got worse as prices have continued to drop. Like other oil producers, BP is looking to cut exploration projects and costs and in January announced that it was to cut 5 percent of its global workforce. BP said it aimed to reduce its global oil production, or upstream, headcount by 4,000 to 20,000 as it undergoes a $3.5 billion restructuring program. Its headcount totaled around 80,000 at the end of 2015, it said.

This came after Standard & Poor's cuts its rating on Shell and placed it on a negative watch. The ratings agency also slashed its rating of BHP Billiton and put it on negative watch and placed Rio Tinto on negative watch as well, due to the poor outlook for commodities. Shares of both companies ended sharply down on Tuesday. In general, mining stocks performed poorly on Tuesday due to the decline in oil prices, with Anglo American finishing almost 8 percent down. On the earnings front, oil major BP reported an annual loss of $6.5 billion in 2015, its worst in 20 years amid the persistently low oil price, sending shares to close down 8.7 percent.

Follow This, a Dutch organisation that spearheaded a number of climate shareholder resolutions at Royal Dutch Shell’s AGMs over the past three years said it also filed one with the Anglo-Dutch company for 2019. It also plans to file a resolution with U.S. rivals Exxon Mobil and Chevron “unless other parties file a similar resolution,” it said in a statement. The 2019 resolution calls on the companies to set and publish targets for the reduction of carbon emissions in line with the 2015 Paris Climate Accords to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. The targets should include emissions from the drilling and refining operations as well as for the burning of fuels and products such as plastics which are sold to millions of customers around the world, known as Scope 3 emissions. BP CEO Bob Dudley has repeatedly opposed setting targets for Scope 3 emission reduction. It calls on the companies to set clear metrics to measure greenhouse gas emissions and disclose information on progress. “Targets should be on the agenda of every oil company, given that the oil industry can make or break the Paris Climate Agreement,” said Follow This founder Mark van Baal. BP and Shell confirmed the resolutions had been filed. BP “will consider the resolution carefully and make a response and recommendation to our shareholders as part of our Notice of Meeting prior to the AGM,” a spokesman said. A Shell spokeswoman said the Follow This resolution was “unnecessary” after the company last week announced plans to set sector-leading emission targets that will be linked to executive pay and include Scope 3 emissions. The announcement, which followed extensive discussions with investors, marked a reversal for Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden who had previously opposed setting targets. “We are planning short-term targets for the net carbon footprint of our energy products. This will allow us to demonstrate clear progress towards our long-term ambition in this area,” Shell said. Shell’s board has consistently opposed the Follow This resolutions which were voted down with less than 6.34 percent of the vote since 2015. In the 2018 AGM, the discussion around the resolution however led to a heated debate between van Beurden and van Baal. BP earlier this year announced plans to keep emissions flat over the decade to 2025, which are nevertheless limited to its own operations. BP has faced several shareholder resolutions in the past focused mostly on emissions disclosure.

443,2016-03-05,2016,3.0,5,,BP boss gets 20% pay rise despite firm's $6.5B loss,"BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley's total pay rose 20 percent to nearly $20 million in 2015, a year when the oil major settled most of its U.S. oil spill litigations but also posted a record loss as crude prices plummeted. BP has slashed thousands of jobs and sharply cut investments over the past year in the face of the market downturn, while reaching a landmark $20 billion settlement to resolve most claims from its deadly 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Dudley's pay has risen steadily since he took office following the spill and has become a regular point of tension with shareholders. The firm's annual shareholder meeting is scheduled for April. Last month BP reported a $6.5 billion loss for 2015 as its underlying replacement cost profit, its definition of net income, dropped to $5.9 billion in 2015 from $12.1 billion the previous year. BP argues it needs to remain competitive and its remuneration is lower than most U.S. rivals. In its annual report on Friday, BP said executive directors received no increase in base salary in 2015 and that senior leadership would not see salary increases this year either. Dudley's total pay was boosted by a payment to his U.S. pension scheme and that rise stems from deferred bonus payments, the company said. Ann Dowling, chair of BP's remuneration committee, said the company delivered strong operating and safety performances throughout 2015. The company's operating cash flow and underlying replacement cost profit were both well ahead of targets set for 2015, BP said. ""The oil price is outside BP's control, but executives performed strongly in managing the things they could control and for which they are accountable. BP surpassed expectations on most measures and directors' remuneration reflects this,"" Dowling said in the report. BP said that while industry costs had come down sharply following the near 70 percent decline in oil prices over the past 20 months, ""this will be a tough period of intense change for the industry as it adapts to this new reality."" BP has said it expects oil prices to remain low in the near term. Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said in the current low oil price environment BP aimed to ensure it covered capital expenditure and shareholder distributions with operating cash flow. ""We anticipate that all the actions we are taking will capture more deflation and drive the point of rebalance to below $60 per barrel,"" he said. BP's oil and gas proved reserve replacement ratio dropped for a second year to 61 percent, compared with 63 percent in 2014, indicating that the company has not discovered or acquired sufficient reserves to offset production and the natural decline of wells. The fall was due to a low number of final investment decisions adding new projects and reduced activity in Alaska and the U.S. Lower 48 "" states, BP said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/05/bp-boss-gets-20-pay-rise-despite-firms-65b-loss.html,Business News,CNBC

""Today's action holds BP accountable with the largest environmental penalty of all time while launching one of the most extensive environmental restoration efforts ever undertaken,"" U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a statement. The company at the time said its total pre-tax charges from the spill set aside for criminal and civil penalties and cleanup costs were around $53.8 billion. Under the terms of the original agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Gulf Coast states, BP will pay at least $12.8 billion for Clean Water Act fines and natural resource damages, plus $4.9 billion to states. The payouts will be staggered over as many as 18 years.

The Interior Department's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement announced the finalized regulations, which include more stringent design requirements and operational procedures for offshore U.S. oil and gas operations. The new standards come nearly six years after a deadly explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig off the cost of Louisiana, which led to the worst oil spill of all time. The Macondo well blowout and the fire on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on April 20, 2010, killed 11 workers. ""The well control rule is a vital part of our extensive reform agenda to strengthen, update and modernize our offshore energy program using lessons learned from Deepwater Horizon,"" said Interior Secretary Sally Jewell. To improve the ""culture of safety"" on oil rigs and prevent future spills or blowouts, the new rule tightens requirements for blowout preventers, well design, well control casing, cementing and sub-sea containment. It also calls for real-time monitoring, third party reviews of equipment, regular inspections and safe drilling margin requirements. ""We listened extensively to industry and other stakeholders and heard their concerns loud and clear,"" said Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management Janice Schneider. ""This rule includes both prescriptive and performance-based standards."" Ocean protection advocacy group Oceana said that since Congress did not enact legislation to improve offshore drilling safety, the new standards by the Interior Department were ""a significant improvement over the status quo."" Oceana Vice President Jacqueline Savitz said many measures in the final rule were standards already used by industry. The Interior Department bureau has reported that offshore drilling caused at least 1,066 injuries, 496 fires and explosions, 22 losses of well control, 11 big oil spills and 11 fatalities since the Deepwater Horizon accident. ""The only way to truly ensure there will never be another disaster of the magnitude of Deepwater Horizon is to stop drilling offshore,"" Savitz said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/14/six-years-after-bp-spill-us-sets-new-offshore-oil-safety-rules.html,Energy,CNBC
446,2016-04-14,2016,4.0,14,,BP shareholders vote against CEO Dudley's pay rise,"BP responded to a barrage of complaints from shareholders on Thursday over CEO Bob Dudley's pay package amid falling profits and job losses at the oil major. The London-listed company reported a loss of $6.5 billion for 2015, its worst annual loss in 20 years. But it also increased Dudley's pay package (which includes pension payments) by 20 percent to $19.6 million from $16.4 million a year before. Reacting to angry investors, who voted against the pay rise at the annual general meeting taking place in London, Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said the company had always judged executive performance ""not on the price of oil or bottom line profit but on measures that are clearly within management's control."" ""But let me be clear. We hear you,"" he said, according to a transcript of his speech on the company website. ""On remuneration, the shareholders' reactions are very strong. They are seeking change in the way we should approach this in the future ... we will sit down with our largest shareholders to make sure we understand their concerns and return to seek your support for a renewed policy."" The AGM on Thursday presented the remuneration report to shareholders, but a vote on the policy - which 59.11 percent voted against - was only advisory. The pay rise was actually voted for at the AGM 2014 and the next time shareholders can change the CEO's pay rise is in 2017. Nonetheless, any dissent or revolt could put pressure on Dudley and the company. A slew of shareholders vented their anger in the days leading up to the meeting. ShareSoc, an organization that promotes the interests of private investors, said in a press release this week that it considered the pay of the CEO to be ""simply too high."" Royal London Asset Management, which holds a £443 million ($626 million) stake in BP called the increase ""unreasonable and insensitive."" ""While we acknowledge BP has had to weather a turbulent period for oil markets, we strongly believe that executive remuneration should remain tied to performance,"" Ashley Hamilton Claxton, corporate governance manager at Royal London Asset Management, told CNBC via an emailed statement. BP has taken restructuring charges as plunging oil prices continue to weigh on the firm. Brent crude prices have tumbled around 65 percent since June 2014 to trade around $44 a barrel this week. BP's share price has lost 30 percent during the same time period. However, Dudley has also received praise in the five years that he has been CEO, including for his response to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010 and the lawsuits that followed. In the invite to Thursday's AGM, BP praised Dudley for the way he has ""transformed BP into a safer, stronger and simpler business"" and the way he has ""guided BP's recovery to a position of greater resilience."" The U.K.'s Institute of Directors (IoD) has also urged shareholders to scrutinize the pay deal for Bob Dudley. It believes if it had been endorsed it could have set the ""wrong message"" to other companies. ""We are concerned ... that Dudley's £14 million pay package will seem unjustified to many shareholders, considering the performance of the company over the last 12 months,"" Simon Walker, director general of the IoD said in a statement. ""BP is not a badly run company, and its current woes are common to other firms in the sector. Nevertheless, the U.K. corporate governance code is clear that pay should be tightly linked to performance and that targets should be stretching and rigorously applied.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/14/bps-dudley-faces-stormy-agm-over-20m-pay.html,CEOS,CNBC

First-quarter replacement cost loss came in at $485 million, compared with a profit of $2.1 billion a year ago. The replacement cost loss came in well above expectations of $140 million in a poll of analysts provided by the company. Replacement cost profit is a common accounting measure to report profits in the oil industry which takes into account the fluctuations in the price of oil. Oil prices have seen something of a rebound since BP's last earnings when a barrel was trading around $33 with Brent crude now fetching around $44 a barrel but there is no sign of major producers curtailing output in a bid to support prices further. In a statement accompanying the results, BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley said that despite the challenging environment, the company was ""driving towards our near-term goal of rebalancing BP's cash flows. Operational performance is strong and our work to reset costs has considerable momentum and is delivering results. Furthermore, development of our next wave of material upstream projects is well on track."" Shares of BP rose 2.3 percent in early trade on Tuesday. In February, BP announced its worst annual loss in 20 years, reporting a loss of $6.5 billion for 2015 as a whole.

Including these charges and other offsetting effects, BP reported a replacement cost loss for the fourth quarter of 2015 of $2.2 billion. On an underlying basis, replacement cost profit in the first quarter was $532 million, compared with $2.57 billion for the same period in 2015. BP announced an unchanged dividend for the quarter of 10 cents per ordinary share, expected to be paid in June. The group said that it had lowered costs and would continue to do so, expecting total organic capital expenditure in 2016 to be around $17 billion and, ""in the event of continued low oil prices,"" sees flexibility to move to $15-17 billion in 2017, it said. Last week, around 60 percent of BP shareholders rejected Bob Dudley's £14 million pay package – although the revolt was more symbolic as the pay had already been received by Dudley.

450,2017-04-06,2017,4.0,6,Karolin Schaps,BP cuts CEO's pay package after shareholder backlash,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP has cut Chief Executive Bob Dudley’s 2016 pay package by 40 percent to $11.6 million, the latest British bluechip company to rein in executive pay after a wave of shareholder revolts. The oil company has reduced Dudley’s payout and introduced changes from this year that will lower executives’ performance incentives. The cuts come after around 60 percent of shareholders opposed BP’s pay policy at last year’s annual general meeting. Executive pay has come under growing scrutiny in Britain after a string of corporate scandals, such as the collapse of store chain BHS, which has fuelled mistrust of the high levels of pay awarded to company bosses. “We applaud the BP remuneration committee for being proactive in responding to the shareholder revolt last year and see this as a milestone in the engagement between companies and shareholders,” said Ashley Hamilton Claxton, corporate governance manager at Royal London Asset Management. BP’s pay policy changes, which will apply for the coming three years if approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting in London on May 17, include lowering Dudley’s maximum long-term payout to five times salary from seven times and cutting bonus payments by a quarter. “I have consulted widely with shareholders and listened to and sought to act on their concerns, and have been sensitive to developments in the society in which we work,” Ann Dowling, chair of BP’s remuneration committee, said in the company’s annual report published on Thursday. Dudley’s 2016 pay cut was a result of “downward discretion” to the four components of his total pay, the company said. Even after a cut of nearly $8 million, Dudley’s pay remains well above that of rival European oil companies. Shell’s Ben van Beurden was awarded an 8.263 million euro ($8.8 million) pay package for 2016, a 60 percent jump year on year, while Total’s Patrick Pouyanne took home 3.8 million euros last year. BP Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary’s overall pay package will be cut by 18 percent to 4.2 million pounds ($5.2 million). Other large British companies, such as Reckitt Benckiser and GlaxoSmithKline, have also cut executives’ pay after shareholders had voiced concerns about their remuneration plans. BP’s annual report also showed the oil company cut a net amount of 5,300 jobs in 2016, after reducing 4,700 roles in 2015, as part of plans to rein in spending in response to weak oil prices.

453,2016-06-23,2016,6.0,23,,UK would 'probably never recover' from Brexit: Former BP CEO,"Former BP CEO John Browne said Thursday the U.K. would likely never recover from leaving the European Union. Browne spoke as Britons headed to the polls to vote on their future relations with the economic bloc. ""I will be holding my breath, but I believe that the common sense of the people of the U.K. will be to stay in the EU,"" Browne told CNBC. ""The cost of uncertainty is high, and you know, you very rarely recover that cost."" ""The uncertainty created by leaving would be so great, we'd probably never recover from it,"" he added. Browne, a supporter of the remain camp, wrote in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal earlier this week that polls showing an extremely tight race have created ""perhaps the most worrying moment for the United Kingdom since World War II."" Polls leading up to the nonbinding referendum have swung both ways, with the latest numbers indicating a small lead in favor of remaining in the EU, after previously showing the leave option had a slight edge. Betting markets are putting their money on a lead for the remain vote. Earlier in the day on CNBC, former European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet expressed caution that there was no way to know in advance how the U.K. would vote, but said a win for leave would have large ramifications. ""It's absolutely clear for me as it is for the IMF, for [British Prime Minister] David Cameron, for the Bank of England, that there are enormous costs associated short term, medium term and long term associated with Brexit,"" Trichet said. In his interview on CNBC, Browne said leave proponents were overstating how little independence the U.K. has. He also said leaving could open the doors to ""a more nationalistic approach with bad consequences"" across Europe. Browne also said the uncertainty created by a leave vote would increase the cost of capital. He also addressed concerns about the impact of globalization on the U.K.'s economy. ""It's up to us to make that work for people and to stop the middle of all economies being hollowed out,"" Browne said.

Oil and gas companies were boosted over the first nine months of the year by a recovery in crude prices as years of cost cuts started to kick in. But the drop in oil prices from more than $85 a barrel in early October to around $60 this week has revived concerns over their long-term recovery. “We have no plans to take down any projects because I don’t see a change in the mid-to-long-term outlook,” Equinor Chief Executive Eldar Saetre told Reuters on the sidelines of a carbon conference in Edinburgh. He added that Equinor’s portfolio could generate cash at oil prices below $50 a barrel. In October Equinor cut its spending for 2018 to $10 billion from $11 billion through cost cuts. BP chief Bob Dudley was similarly resolute. “We’re planning the future of BP and always have through the cycle on $50 to $60 (a barrel), so it (the oil price) is not changing our capital investment plan. That hasn’t changed at all,” he told reporters in Edinburgh. However, Dudley said the company might reprioritize some projects as a results of the slump in crude prices. BP said it would spend between $15 billion and $17 billion next year.

455,2016-02-26,2016,2.0,26,,Former BP rig supervisor found not guilty in oil spill case,"Feb 25 (Reuters) - A former BP Plc supervisor was found not guilty by a New Orleans jury on Thursday of a single pollution charge stemming from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon drilling disaster that killed 11 people. Robert Kaluza was the last of four people who had faced charges in connection with the disaster, the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history. Kaluza, along with another former well-site manager, was accused of ignoring warning signs and botching safety testing that resulted in the rupture and explosion of BP’s Macondo well, sending millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. A jury on Thursday found Kaluza not guilty of a single misdemeanor count of violating the U.S. Clean Water Act. If convicted, he could have faced up to a year in jail. The U.S. Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the jury’s decision. Kaluza and Donald Vidrine, the two highest-ranking supervisors on board the Deepwater Horizon rig, had initially faced charges of manslaughter and violating the Clean Water Act. The federal government dismissed involuntary manslaughter charges against the men, saying a review after the incident determined the case did not meet the criteria for gross negligence. In March, 2015, a federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling to drop charges of seamen’s manslaughter against Kaluza and Vidrine, saying the men’s responsibilities on the rig did not constitute the “marine operations, maintenance, and navigation” of a ship. Vidrine in December pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor violation of the Clean Water Act and was sentenced to probation, the Justice Department said. None of the four charged in the disaster have been sentenced to jail time. BP has sustained more than $42 billion in charges from the disaster aboard the rig. The company is awaiting a separate ruling from a New Orleans federal judge, expected some time this year, over its fines under the U.S. Clean Water Act.

456,2016-07-26,2016,7.0,26,,Oil giant BP records Q2 replacement cost loss of $2.2 billion against a loss of $6.3 billion last year,"With the slump in oil prices showing no signs of abating, 2016 does not look like a vintage year for the industry's biggest companies. A plunging oil price seems to be the culprit, with WTI, the main U.S. indicator, down 10.76 percent in July, and apparently set for its worst monthly performance since December 2015. Supply seems to have recovered, at the same time as concerns about global demand for oil grew. BP was the first of the publicly listed oil giants to report this earnings season on Tuesday, ahead of Shell results on Thursday and Exxon Mobil on Friday. The market wasn't particularly encouraged by the results as it warned refining margins (the difference between the price of oil as a raw material and its products) would stay under significant pressure in the third quarter, and reported underlying replacement cost profit falling to $720 million, below analyst expectations. Bob Dudley, the company's chief executive, warned of a ""challenging"" environment and its share price dipped by around 1 percent in early London trade. Exxon was one of the biggest fallers on the Dow Monday, as energy stocks performed poorly. The sector posted its worst daily performance since June 27, the second trading session after the Brexit vote, when it fell 2.54 percent. The oil price is being weighed down as broader economic concerns are dampening many traders' expectations for demand. The prospect of Brexit — and subsequent uncertainty around Europe and the U.K.'s trading relationships and its consequences for manufacturing — is seen as one of the biggest risks to the price of oil. Member countries of the Organization of the Economic Co-operation and Development and Europe drove the unexpectedly high demand earlier this year – and if their need for oil doesn't meet forecasts, they may have to be cut. Many of the oil companies are about to raise capital expenditure in the third quarter of the year in the hope of greater prices, according to a forecast by Pantheon Macroeconomics. Major agency forecasts still suggest demand growth, and the International Energy Agency (IEA) recently upgraded its 2016 demand growth forecast on stronger demand than expected in developed markets. However, many in the markets sense that the second half of 2016 is going to be worse than thought for demand, with 2017 even trickier. Analysts at UBS blamed ""rising prices and macroeconomic headwinds"" for a predicted slowdown in 2017 in a research note.

457,2018-02-02,2018,2.0,2,Devika  Krishna Kumar,"BP, Trafigura join shippers complaining to U.S. regulator about Colonial rates","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Units of BP PLC and Trafigura AG on Friday became the latest companies to file a complaint with a U.S. regulator over shipping rates charged by Colonial Pipeline Co, which operates the biggest fuel pipeline system in the United States. The complaint follows an identical one from oil major Chevron Corp leading refiner Valero Energy Corp and Delta Air Lines Inc filed in November over the fees charged by Colonial to ship fuel, including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. BP Products North America Inc, Trafigura Trading LLC and TCPU Inc urged FERC to set the matter for hearing and sought to consolidate their complaint with the November one. “Good cause exists to believe that Colonial’s existing rates... are unjust and unreasonable,” the companies said in a 917-page complaint filed with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The complaints could lead to the first regulatory examination of Colonial Pipeline’s rates in nearly two decades. The pipeline hauls more than 3 million barrels of fuel from the refinery hub on the U.S. Gulf Coast to northeast distribution centers every day. Chevron, Valero and Delta complained to FERC that Colonial overcharged the companies by more than $60 million combined, and is potentially monopolizing fuel delivery into the New York region. BP and Trafigura joined the companies in alleging that Colonial’s opaque fee structure pushed its 2016 interstate revenue to exceed its costs by $339.3 million, earning it about a 29 percent realized return on equity. “Excess earnings of this magnitude are far above the levels that the Commission has found to be sufficient to justify holding hearings in recent rate investigations of other pipelines,” BP and Trafigura said. Overall, BP Products’ total estimated overpayment to Colonial for shipping fuel between January 2016 through December 2017, including so-called contentious “product loss allocation fees,” was $55.5 million, according to the complaint. Trafigura’s total estimated overpayment to Colonial during the same period was $27.2 million, the complaint said. The companies seek reparations of those amounts and asked FERC to investigate whether Colonial should be allowed to charge market-based rates due to its monopoly in some markets. Colonial could not immediately be reached for comment but the company defended its fees in December saying the complaint from Chevron, Valero and Delta was based on “purposefully manipulated” financial data. Others including refiner Phillips 66, Flint Hills Resources LP and Castleton Commodities have filed to intervene in the proceeding.

Speaking at the World Energy Conference in Istanbul he said the current oil price was giving producers a little more breathing room. ""We look at it on a daily basis and it is pretty much in balance. It is pretty much there, within half a million barrels one way or the other,"" Dudley told CNBC. Dudley added with oil stocks still so high, the wider market sentiment may take time to change. On the cost of production per barrel, Dudley told CNBC that said BP was looking to re-base targets: ""We said $60 next year; we are under $55 now. We can see our way to $53 next year."" ""We are going to work hard make these sustainable, so that we don't have to rely on swings in prices that are volatile and not healthy for industries and consumers and markets."" The oil-producing cartel OPEC announced at its meeting in Algeria late last month that it plans to agree on an output cut by the time it meets in late November. The targeted range is to cut production to a range of 32.50 million barrels per day (bpd) to 33.0 million bpd. On Monday the Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said he was optimistic that while a production deal could be reached, OPEC shouldn't curb supply too tightly. Dudley added that the meeting of oil suppliers in Algiers gave those looking for a supply freeze deal some reason to be optimistic ""I will note that countries that traditionally don't have good relations actually made some understanding and agreement there,"" he said. ""It is just the fact that people are talking and there is cooperation is very significant."" And the BP CEO also pointed out that although the Russian oil industry was ""running very fast,"" the fact that they were taking part in supply discussions was in itself significant. Dudley added that Iran's supply has taken time to get close to pre-sanction levels and that is perhaps what had delayed any supply freeze deal until now. On future investment, the BP CEO said although his company had to be careful with where it allocated cash it was important to keep building future projects as existing ones wind down. ""There are some really good projects. There is one in the Gulf of Mexico. It was $20 billion dollars [cost] in 2011 and it is now under $9 billion and there are a couple of examples of that,"" he said. Hollywood came to BP this summer when events of the deadly oil rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 were depicted in the film ""Deepwater Horizon,"" starring Mark Wahlberg. The oil firm criticized the movie as being an inaccurate dramatization and Dudley said Monday that BP now had now the opportunity to move on. ""We've drawn a line under it and it has cost us $61.6 billion, not to put too fine a point on it. ""We know what it is going to cost us. Now we just to be safe, operate reliably, that will give us reliable cash flows and get back to being an oil company,"" he said. The dividend on BP's shares is around 6 percent yield, which is viewed as highly attractive in the current environment but Dudley said he would continue to defend the payout. ""We've got $17 billion dollars of capital per year and we have probably over $25 billion dollars of cash cost. We can certainly reduce those before we need to cut a dividend which is in the $6 to $7 billion dollar range, "" he said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/10/bp-ceo-oil-market-is-in-balance.html,,CNBC

Oil majors including BP and Total are investing in the waters of Senegal and Mauritania in the hope of repeating the recent exploration success of smaller players. “Yakaar-1...further confirms our belief that offshore Senegal and Mauritania is a world-class hydrocarbon basin,” Bernard Looney, BP Upstream chief executive officer, said. New York-listed Kosmos in 2015 discovered a gas pool in the Tortue 1 exploration well, part of the Greater Tortue Complex spanning Senegal and Mauritania, which contained more than 15 trillion cubic feet of gas. Since then, BP has formulated plans to acquire a 30 percent interest in the two offshore blocks called Saint-Louis Profond that includes the Senegalese sector of the Tortue field and Cayar Profond. BP has also agreed to buy a stake of close to 60 percent in Kosmos’ Mauritania exploration blocks. Gas from the Tortue field is due to begin flowing in 2021 and is set to be exported from a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility.

461,2019-03-13,2019,3.0,13,Ron Bousso,BP teams up with EDF to tackle methane leaks,"Houston (Reuters) - BP urged the U.S. government to tighten rules limiting methane leaks from oil and gas operations as it teamed up with a prominent environmental group to develop technologies to limit emissions of the potent greenhouse gas. The London-based company joined rival Royal Dutch Shell in a call to President Donald Trump’s administration to tighten methane regulation, rather than weaken Obama-era rules as it has planned. “We believe in direct federal regulation of methane for new and existing sources here in the United States,” Bernard Looney, head of BP oil and gas production, told Reuters at the CERAWeek conference by IHS Markit in Houston on Tuesday. Methane leaks from oil and gas production, storage and transportation are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions that are blamed for climate change. The energy industry is the largest source of U.S. methane emissions, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. BP aimed to reduce methane emissions to 0.2 percent of its overall oil and gas production by 2025, and was able to achieve that target in 2018, Looney said. The company is about to deploy a drone carrying infrared cameras to monitor around 1,500 wells in its U.S. onshore shale operations to detect early signs of leaks, he said. BP announced on Wednesday a three-year partnership with the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), a New York-based nonprofit environmental advocacy group, aimed at developing further technologies to detect and prevent methane leaks. Leaks are rising as natural gas production increases to meet growing demand for electricity. Methane is the primary component of natural gas, and has more than 80 times the heat-trapping potential of carbon dioxide in the first 20 years after it escapes into the atmosphere, scientists say. With investors ramping up pressure on companies to reduce carbon emissions and focus on clean energy, limiting methane has become central. “For us at BP, gas is absolutely central for the world’s need for more energy and at the same time less emissions,” Looney said. EDF President Fred Krupp said that methane is responsible for more than a quarter of the global warming experienced today. If all energy companies achieved methane emission targets similar to BP, it would be equal to shutting roughly 2,000 big coal-fired power plants, Krupp said. “The reputation of natural gas is going to be determined not only by BP’s performance but by the performance of the fuel overall,” Krupp said.

462,2016-11-01,2016,11.0,1,,BP third-quarter profit nearly halves but soundly beats consensus,"BP has reported net profit for the third quarter of $1.62 billion, trouncing consensus expectations of $686 million, but still only delivering around half of last year's result for the period. This as the oil major sliced spending by another $1 billion dollars as the hit from weaker oil prices continued to bite. The company warned industry refining margins will continue to be under pressure in the fourth quarter yet despite this, the oil major says it expects a slight improvement in the final quarter of the year. Underlying replacement cost profit, the actual metric that BP use for net income, came in at $933 million for the quarter, compared with $1.8 billion a year ago. Shares slipped by around 1.2 percent as the European session began on Tuesday. Brian Gilvary, BP's chief financial officer said in the company's press release: ""We continue to make good progress in adapting to the challenging price and margin environment. We remain on track to rebalance organic cash flows next year at $50 to $55 a barrel, underpinned by continued strong operating reliability and momentum in resetting costs and capital spending."" ""At the same time we are investing in the projects, businesses and options to deliver growth in the years ahead,"" the statement added. Weakness was centered around BP's upstream operations which reported an underlying pre-tax loss compared to profits in both the second quarter of 2016 and this period a year ago. The company pointed to weaker oil and non-U.S. gas prices and lower gas marketing and trading as responsible for the decline. The contribution from Russia's Rosneft, from which BP receives a 35 percent share of net income for its stake remained positive but came in less than a third of the third quarter 2015 figure. Production for the quarter was in line with the consensus figure of 2.11 million barrels of oil equivalent per day while net debt at the British oil and gas major rose to $32.4 billion versus $25.6 billion a year ago. Earnings per share of 8.56 cents came in far ahead of broker estimates of 3.31 cents and BP is set to maintain its dividend at 10 cents per share. Shares fell 1.3 percent as the European session opened on Tuesday. Jason Gammel, equities analyst at Jefferies, thought BP's numbers looked fine but were overshadowed by a stronger performance at peer Royal Dutch Shell which also reported on Tuesday morning. According to Gammel, ""There is nothing in the underlying numbers which are concerning to me."" Turning to the company's spending plans, the Jefferies analyst said he saw a continuing but much more moderate decline in spending on the horizon. ""We are projecting that we will see a 5 percent decline in capital spending in 2017, relative to 2016, but this follows a 42 percent reduction in capital spending from 2014 through 2016 so it really has been a very marked decrease in spending,"" Gammel told CNBC Tuesday. Focusing on the extreme sensitivity to the level of the oil price for the sustainability of BP's plans, Gammel noted: ""I would almost argue that these companies are underspending right now if they want to replace their production, because this is a declining asset base. The point is well taken that the dividend is not well covered without further capex (capital expenditure) cuts with oil prices in the low 40s but in mid-50 type price environment, there is some room for further capex expansion and still covering dividends.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/31/oil-major-bp-reports-net-profit-of-162-billion-for-third-quarter-beating-estimates.html,Earnings,CNBC

464,2018-05-18,2018,5.0,18,"Ron Bousso, Dmitry Zhdannikov","Exclusive: BP chief sees shale, OPEC cooling oil markets","LONDON (Reuters) - BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley expects a flood of U.S. shale and the reopening of OPEC taps to cool the oil market after crude rose above $80 a barrel this week. U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to exit an international nuclear deal with Iran and revive sanctions on the OPEC member country, as well as Venezuela’s plummeting output, has helped to lift oil prices to their highest since 2014. But BP sees oil falling to between $50 and $65 a barrel due to surging shale output and OPEC’s capacity to boost production, Dudley told Reuters. “Clearly the withdrawal of the United States from the Iran nuclear deal has brought a lot of uncertainty to the market,” he said in an interview. Crude exports from Iran, the third-largest member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, could drop by 300,000 to 1 million barrels per day (bpd) as a result of U.S. sanctions, the CEO said, citing internal BP forecasts. Dudley said he expected the figure to be “at the lower end” of the range. The 30 percent recovery in crude prices since February has given strong tailwind to oil companies such as BP, whose profits recovered last year after a three-year slump in the market. The U.S. Energy Information Administration this month boosted its forecast of growth in domestic crude production in 2018 to an all-time high of 11.17 million bpd, as shale drillers accelerate activity. The surge in U.S. output has been offset by deep supply cuts for over a year by OPEC and other producers including Russia. OPEC’s de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, assured key consumers that the world would have adequate supplies even if Iran’s exports dropped sharply. Markets have so far been able to absorb oil’s rise without impacting demand growth, but Dudley said a sustained crude price of over $80 would be unhealthy. “Two years ago, when the price was $27, it was great for global growth, the engines of the consuming economies, but it was terrible for producing countries and that led to producing countries not being able to purchase things as well. That was not a healthy price.” “I think when you get above $80, it is not a healthy price either.” Although the International Energy Agency this week cut its outlook for oil demand growth in 2018 due to rising crude prices, BP still expects consumption to expand by 1.7 million bpd, extending a period of strong growth. The world has experienced an unprecedented decade of economic growth that is likely to continue even with sanctions and trade tensions between the United States and China, Dudley said. “We’re about to begin to see political factors creating trade dislocations, sanctions and things like that. They will have impacts here and there but the overall economic growth rates appear to be not overheated,” he said.

466,2016-03-21,2016,3.0,21,Margarita Antidze,BP expects flat output at its Azeri oilfields this year,"TBILISI (Reuters) - British oil major BP expects flat oil production in 2016 at its Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) oilfields in Azerbaijan, where it plans two rounds of maintenance this year, the company’s regional head said. Production at the ACG fields, which account for most of Azerbaijan’s oil output and are operated by a consortium led by BP, totaled 31.3 million tonnes last year, down slightly from 31.5 million tonnes in 2014. “Thanks to the operational efficiency programs we have put in place, we expect ACG production to continue to be more or less stable as it has been for the past few years,” Gordon Birrell, BP’s regional president for Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, said in an emailed response to Reuters questions. “I am confident ... ACG will continue to deliver competitive performance for many years to come.” Birrell said the company planned two maintenance programs on ACG in 2016. “The exact time of these will be announced later in the year,” he said. BP had two sets of planned maintenance last year - in May and November. Azerbaijan’s crude oil and condensate production in 2015 fell 0.8 percent to 41.7 million tonnes. BP in Azerbaijan has adapted to low global oil prices, Birrell said. “We believe we are in good shape and have been successful in strongly adapting to the current challenging conditions,” he said. “We have identified clear actions and have effective plans in place to increase efficiency in our operations and to effectively manage our investment in major projects,” Birrell added, without elaborating. The price of crude has fallen to around $40 per barrel from over $110 in mid-2014, forcing many oil producers, including Azerbaijan, to revise government spending and change currency policies to soften the resultant shock to the budget. “We expect the current challenging business environment to continue in 2016,” Birrell said. BP had been trying to stabilize oil output in Azerbaijan, essential for the bulk of the nation’s state revenues, after President Ilham Aliyev publicly criticized the company in 2012 for failing to deliver on promises to increase output. On BP’s other major project in Azerbaijan, the Shah Deniz gas field, Birrell said it continued to move ahead with “a number of milestones successfully achieved”. “It is over 66 percent complete in terms of engineering, procurement and construction, and remains on target for first gas delivery (from Shah Deniz II) to Turkey in 2018 and supplies to Europe expected in 2020,” Birrell said. He added the company had no major maintenance program for Shah Deniz this year, after such work took place last August. Shah Deniz is being developed by an international consortium led by BP. The offshore field is estimated to contain between 1.2 trillion and 1.5 trillion cubic meters of gas. Shah Deniz I has been pumping gas since 2006, and gas from its second stage is expected to reach Europe by 2020. Natural gas output from Shah Deniz was 9.9 billion cubic meters (bcm) last year, the same as the previous year. Azerbaijan’s total natural gas production rose to 29.7 bcm last year, from 29.4 bcm a year earlier.

468,2016-01-24,2016,1.0,24,,BP Egypt says LNG shipment was diverted to manage peak demand,"CAIRO, Jan 24 (Reuters) - BP Egypt said on Sunday that one of its LNG shipments to Egypt was held back this month as part of a deal over the timing of deliveries, and the petroleum ministry dismissed reports that it was linked to payment problems. LNG tanker British Sapphire was diverted to Brazil rather than discharging in Egypt earlier this month, and traders had said the diversion was related to payment delays at state gas board EGAS. EGAS also denied the reports. Egypt is facing a dollar shortage that has hit its ability to import, creating delays in opening letters of credit and causing goods to pile up at ports. “BP has been awarded an LNG supply contract to Egypt to supply cargoes from mid 2015. Six cargoes have been successfully delivered and BP has either received payment in full or received agreed collateral from EGAS for all 6 cargoes,” BP Egypt told Reuters in a statement. “The seventh cargo was postponed to the third quarter of 2016 based on a mutual decision between EGAS and BP to manage supply for peak summer demand,” the statement added. BP said it remained committed to deliver LNG cargoes to EGAS “in accordance with the contractual arrangements in place”. Egypt became a major market for LNG shippers after the launch of two floating import terminals last year and as the country looks to plug an acute energy shortage that has halted industrial production during summer months and caused rolling blackouts. According to financial and trade sources, last month Egypt asked for 90 days to pay for LNG deliveries, up from the traditional 15, creating arrears currently estimated at $400-$500 million. EGAS chairman Khaled Abdel Badie told Reuters on Sunday that lower world oil prices should push the country’s LNG import bill for fiscal year 2015-16 down to between $2.75 billion and $3 billion from an originally expected $3.5 billion. The ministry of petroleum on Sunday denied that there has been issues making payments to foreign energy companies. “There is no truth to what has been said about delays in the payment of dues to international companies for the value of agreed upon LNG shipments,” a ministry of petroleum statement said.

469,2018-06-28,2018,6.0,28,Ron Bousso,BP bets on electric car switch with Britain's Chargemaster,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP is buying Britain’s top electric vehicle charging firm Chargemaster and will initially roll out its ultra-fast chargers across its filling station network in the UK before turning its attention to China’s rapidly growing market. Oil and gas major Royal Dutch Shell and carmakers Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Daimler have also made investments in the electric vehicle (EV) market, whose growth is being driven by a shift from polluting fossil fuels. Like its rivals Shell and France’s Total, BP is planning to use its vast global network of filling stations to carve out a position in the EV market, with demand for petrol forecast to peak as early as the end of next decade. “We want to have a leading position in the UK whatever fuel choice our customers have,” Tufan Erginbilgic, head of BP downstream, told Reuters after the company announced the 130 million pound ($170 million) acquisition of Chargemaster. BP forecasts that the global EV fleet will soar to more than 300 million by 2040, from just 1 million in 2016, and said it plans to deploy ultra-fast 150 kilowatt chargers able to deliver 100 miles of range in just 10 minutes across its 1,200 petrol stations in Britain over the next 12 months. Although most EV drivers charge their cars at home or at street charging points, Erginbilgic believes that retail stations will remain essential because only they will offer ultra-fast charging. And as carmakers, battery manufacturers and power providers look for ways to extend the use of EVs beyond urban areas, charging on highways is seen as vital for extending range. “If EVs will be a mass-market product, the world needs to have fast and ultra-fast charging,” Erginbilgic said. Chargemaster, which will be rebranded BP Chargemaster, operates more than 6,500 EV charging points across Britain and has supplied over 50,000 units across Europe. London-based BP plans to invest around $500 million a year in low carbon technology and use its experience in Britain to expand into other rapidly growing markets, first and foremost Germany and China, Erginbilgic said. “China and Germany will definitely be some of the priority markets given the trends… with our ultra-fast charging we can actually enable EV scaling up.” BP announced a partnership in May with China’s NIO Capital to explore investments in EVs, energy infrastructure and battery technology. This followed a joint venture with Shandong Dongming Petrochemical Group to develop retail sites across China. “BP sees the future EV retail market evolving into a model similar to today’s where drivers charge their cars in retail sites,” Erginbilgic said. In January, BP invested $5 million in FreeWire Technologies which manufactures mobile EV rapid charging systems. A month later it linked up with car makers Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi to develop new battery technology.

Swiss bank UBS also slumped, down 7.8 percent, after reporting a surprise outflow of funds from its flagship wealth management business, overshadowing its best annual results since 2010 and a higher than expected dividend payout. BP fell 7.9 percent after reporting its worst annual loss in more than 20 years in 2015. It announced thousands more job cuts following a deep rout in oil prices and maintained its dividend, but the weak results and outlook are bound to pile pressure on the company, which has had to increase borrowing. “BP hasn’t blinked on its dividend, but it is playing chicken with the oil price. BP’s dividend is a mile away from being covered by earnings and the market is saying that this is unsustainable,” said Steve Clayton, head of equities research at Hargreaves Lansdown. “They are a chasm away from their cash break-even oil price of around $60 dollars per barrel,” he said. The STOXX Europe 600 Oil and Gas index dropped 3.9 percent after crude oil prices fell again on worries about top energy consumer China and rising oil supply. Shares in Reposol, Royal Dutch Shell, Eni and Total all fell between 3 and 5 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst index < .FTEU3> dropped 1.7 percent by 1104 GMT, after closing 0.2 percent weaker in the previous session. The index is down more than 7 percent so far this year. BHP Billiton fell 6.6 percent after Standard & Poor’s cut the world’s largest miner’s credit rating and warned it might be lowered further if measures to shore up cash levels were not taken, cementing expectations BHP will slash its dividend for the first time in 15 years. However, some companies advanced on the back of encouraging results and positive company news. Shares in Danske Bank rose 2.7 percent after reporting a forecast-beating pretax profit in the fourth quarter, thanks to higher trading income. The bank also plans to launch a share buy-back programme. Sainsbury’s rose 2 percent after Britain’s second biggest supermarket agreed to buy Argos-owner Home Retail for 1.3 billion pounds to boost its online business and expand sales of items such as electrical goods.

471,2017-02-07,2017,2.0,7,,"BP annual earnings dip to 10-year low, warns OPEC cut could affect 2017 production","BP disappointed analysts on Tuesday morning, reporting lower-than-expected net income in the fourth quarter and annual earnings that dipped to at least a 10-year low. Its shares were down by 2.4 percent in early trade. The oil giant said underlying replacement cost profit, which it uses to measure net income, was $400 million for the quarter, an improvement from a year ago, but below the $560 million that analysts polled by Reuters were expecting. Replacement cost profit is a common accounting measure to report profits in the oil industry which takes into account the fluctuations in the price of oil. For the year, this measure came in at $2.59 billion, which was down from $5.9 billion in 2015. Reuters reported that this metric had hit its lowest in at least 10 years in 2016. The improved figures from a year ago were due to higher oil prices and significantly lower costs. BP added that it is prepared for any volatility that may affect oil prices in the future. ""We have adapted by cutting our controllable cash costs by $7 billion from 2014 - a full year earlier than planned. Continued tight discipline on costs remains essential,"" Bob Dudley, BP group chief executive, said in the accompanying press release. ""With our Deepwater Horizon financial liabilities now substantially behind us, BP is fully focused on the future,"" he added. The oil company bought Australian gas stations at the end of last year and struck a deal to take a 10 percent stake in one of the largest oil fields in the Middle East. Such additions are expected to contribute to higher cash flows but only in the longer term. ""Together with the mostly second half start-up of the new upstream projects expected to come onstream in 2017, these significant and strategic additions mean that BP now anticipates balancing its organic sources and uses of cash by the end of 2017 in a Brent oil price environment of around $60 a barrel,"" the firm said in a statement. It added that its 2017 outlook was dependent on a variety of different factors that could affect the oil market. ""The actual reported outcome will depend on the exact timing of project start-ups, acquisition and divestment activities, OPEC quotas and entitlement impacts in our production-sharing agreements,"" it said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/07/bp-fourth-quarter-earnings-come-in-at-497-million-missing-analyst-expectations.html,Earnings,CNBC

We're going to plan on $55 to $60 ... for the next five years, and we're going to live within a strict capital diet,"" he said during an interview on CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" on the sidelines of the CERAWeek by IHS Markit in Houston. For the British oil giant, that means keeping its capital spending program between $15 billion and $17 billion over the same period of time, Dudley added. That is roughly 30 percent below spending levels prior to the oil price crash in 2014, he said. Oil prices rebounded above $50 a barrel after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 11 other exporters agreed to temporarily cut oil production by about 1.8 million barrels a day. But the price bounce has made drilling more profitable for some American producers, leading to an upsurge in U.S. output that has capped gains. The OPEC-led cuts have not solved the challenges of a changing oil market, but they have made businesses more confident to invest, Dudley said. Despite spending less in the coming years, BP will start up new projects and keep costs down, he added. ""BP has quietly been getting ready. 2017 is a really important year for us.

475,2019-05-17,2019,5.0,17,"Ron Bousso, Simon Jessop",BP faces investor push to beef up fight against climate change,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP will face pressure at a meeting next week to set tougher targets to combat climate change, the latest signal from investors that they want the oil and gas industry to do more to clean up its act. After BP’s 2018 carbon emissions rose to their highest in six years, the London-based major is being lobbied by activists and an increasing number of shareholders to ensure its operations are in line with goals set by the 2015 Paris climate deal to curb global warming. BP has already backed a resolution being put to investors on Tuesday for it to be more transparent about its emissions, link executive pay to reducing emissions from BP’s operations and show how future investments meet Paris goals. The motion, proposed by BP and a group of 58 shareholders holding 10 percent of its shares, known as Climate Action 100+, is expected to pass at BP’s annual meeting in Aberdeen. But some investors want BP to go further and follow the lead of rival Royal Dutch Shell, which bowed to years of lobbying and set the toughest industry targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. “BP now is at the same stage as Shell was two to three years ago,” said Eric Rutten, head of the responsible investments committee of Aegon, BP’s biggest Dutch investor with shares worth $26 million in the $142 billion firm, Refinitiv data show. His investment company is backing a resolution drawn up by activist group Follow This that would require BP to reduce emissions not just from its own activities but also from the fuel and products it sells to customers. While the resolution stands little chance of passing, even those not backing it still want BP to step up its commitments. “We’d like to see the company set its own targets,” Ashley Hamilton Claxton, head of responsible investment at Royal London Asset Management, a top-20 BP investor with a 0.4 percent stake. “We’d consider supporting more stringent targets, such as those proposed by Follow This, if the board fails to make meaningful progress,” she said, adding her company would abstain over the Follow This resolution rather than vote against it. BP said in a statement it welcomed engagement with shareholders and wanted “to be a constructive partner in the energy transition. We’re working on this with governments, society and our investors.” BP is not alone in coming under pressure. Follow This and other activists have proposed a similar resolution to shareholders in U.S. energy firm Chevron, while a Follow This motion was rejected by investors in Norway’s majority state-owned Equinor this week. Exxon Mobil, the world’s biggest listed energy firm, has also been pushed by some investors to set emissions targets, although the regulator ruled in April that it did not have to put it to shareholders’ vote. BP has said it aims to keep emissions from its operations flat in the decade until 2025, despite strong growth in its business that has been rebuilding after facing $67 billion in fines and clean-up costs following the disastrous 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. It also invests about $500 million a year on low carbon energy and technologies such as wind and solar. Emissions from BP’s operations, known as Scope 1 and 2, fell in 2018 to 54.4 million tonnes from 56.6 million tonnes in 2017. But BP’s overall carbon dioxide emissions, including from the fuels and chemicals it sells to customers, known as Scope 3, rose in 2018 to the highest level since 2012, reflecting higher oil and gas output. Scope 3 emissions climbed to 437 million tonnes in 2018 from 412 million tonnes a year earlier, according to Refinitiv data. BP's CO2 emissions: tmsnrt.rs/2W0zkEf Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley has repeatedly opposed setting Scope 3 reduction targets, as proposed by the Follow This resolution, saying consumption is outside BP’s control. Bruce Duguid, head of stewardship at investment firm Hermes EOS, which was part of the Climate Action 100+ group, also recommended opposing the Follow This resolution, saying BP needed “flexibility to set its own strategy”. The U.N.-backed Paris climate agreement aims to slash greenhouse gas emissions, produced mostly by burning fossil fuels, to net zero by the end of the century in order to limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius. David Patt, a senior corporate governance and public policy analyst at Legal and General Investment Management, BP’s fourth biggest investor, said the Climate Action 100+ resolution would help investors push BP and other energy firms “into being more ambitious” in the transition to a low carbon world. It was not the end of the process, though. “I see this as the building blocks for deeper conversation in things like Scope 3 in order to make sure the company is successful in the future,” Patt told Reuters.

476,2016-08-09,2016,8.0,9,"Arno Schuetze, Denny Thomas",Exclusive: BP seeks buyers for its half of China petchem venture,"FRANKFURT/HONG KONG (Reuters) - British oil major BP is seeking buyers for its 50 percent stake in Chinese petrochemicals joint venture SECCO, its largest investment in China, in a deal sources said could fetch $2-$3 billion. State-owned China Petroleum & Chemical Corp (Sinopec), which owns the other half of the venture and has a right of first refusal, said it was discussing the conditions put forward by BP, but has made no decision. BP is working with Morgan Stanley to sell its shareholding in the SECCO venture as part of a drive to cash out of businesses where it lacks control, three sources familiar with the matter said. A successful deal would mark BP’s first significant exit from a business in China. Situated in Caojing near Shanghai, SECCO is China’s largest petrochemicals refinery and was built at a cost of $2.7 billion, according to BP’s website. BP shares were up 1.1 percent in morning trade, outpacing a 0.3 percent rise in the FTSE index, as investors digested news that would bolster its cash position and underpin dividends. Sinopec’s Shanghai-listed shares were up 1 percent, slightly outperforming the broader China market. A London-based BP spokesman declined to comment. Morgan Stanley was not available for immediate comment. SECCO, a venture formed in 2001, produces ethylene and propylene, which are used to make resins, plastics and synthetic rubbers. Bankers said Chinese state enterprises were unlikely to step in to buy the stake as executives at many of them are distracted by anti-corruption probes.     BP’s stake has been marketed to existing refinery operators in China, including companies from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Europe, the sources added. Bankers said the stake would also attract interest from Chinese private firms stepping up their presence in petrochemicals. “Even in this low oil price environment, this is one auction that will attract a lot of demand. With most SOEs going slow on M&A, Chinese private enterprises will be active,” one Asia-based oil and gas banker said. The refining and chemicals businesses have been a bright spot for M&A in the oil sector since the sharp drop in oil prices more than two years ago. Lower oil prices have boosted refining profits and demand for oil products around the world. BP, like other global oil and gas companies, has been sharpening its focus on costs and core businesses as it reels from lower oil prices. U.S. rival Chevron and Britain’s BG Group have also recently sold stakes in Asian ventures as they return their focus to their core home markets. BP has sold more than $50 billion of assets since the deadly 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill in order to pay for clean-up costs and legal bills.

479,2016-11-25,2016,11.0,25,"Agnieszka Flak, Karolin Schaps",BP buys stake in Eni's giant Zohr gas field offshore Egypt,"MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - BP (BP.L) has agreed to buy 10 percent of Eni’s (ENI.MI) Shorouk concession offshore Egypt, which includes the giant Zohr gas field, for $375 million, joining other oil majors in increasing bets on the growing gas market. The deal gives Eni much-needed cash as part of its 5 billion euro divestment plan to continue investing and paying dividends despite weak oil prices. The companies also agreed BP could purchase another 5 percent of the field before the end of next year, when the Zohr field is slated to start production, under the same terms and that BP would reimburse Eni around $150 million in past expenditure. Zohr, discovered by Eni last year, has an estimated 850 billion cubic meters of gas in place. It will help plug Egypt’s acute energy shortage and save the country billions of dollars in hard currency that would otherwise be spent on imports. Once an energy exporter, Egypt has turned into a net importer because of declining oil and gas output and increasing consumption. It is trying to encourage quicker development of recent discoveries to fill its energy gap as soon as possible. A run of big gas finds off the Egyptian coast have made the country a top destination for energy investment even as firms seek to save cash to handle low oil prices better. The deal deepens BP and Eni’s partnership in Egypt, where they announced a significant gas discovery in the East Nile Delta in June. A stake in Zohr, one of the biggest ever gas discoveries, will raise BP’s exposure to the gas market, just months after rival Shell became one of the world’s biggest gas traders by acquiring BG Group. BP has earmarked Egypt as one of its key growth markets. It wants to double production there in the coming four years and sell into the growing domestic market. Eni, whose subsidiary IEOC owns 100 percent of the Shorouk concession, is also in the process of selling stakes in its Area 4 field in Mozambique to Exxon Mobil.

Britain's oil major almost tripled its underlying replacement cost profit, used as a proxy by oil firms for net profit, from the year previous when it posted $1.5 billion for the first quarter. The earnings results could help to soothe lingering worries among investors who appeared to have been spooked when, in February, BP announced oil prices would need to hit $60 a barrel this year in order for the London-listed firm to balance its books following a series of investments. Oil prices, which are a major driver of BP's earnings, are approximately 35 percent higher than 12 months ago and appeared to have spurred revenue growth from BP's core oil and gas division. Julian Chillingworth, chief investment officer at Rathbone Brothers, suggested he was ""quite cautious"" in regards to the energy sector given the apparent reluctance for oil prices to move significantly higher than around $50 a barrel. ""I don't think the oil price, and it's always a dangerous thing to say, is going that much higher anytime soon and so consequently I think we would always want to have participation in the sector but it may not be as big a part of portfolios as it was 10 years ago,"" Chillingworth told CNBC on Tuesday.Brent crude traded at around $51.56 a barrel on Tuesday morning, up 0.1 percent, while U.S. crude was around $48.82 a barrel, down 0.02 percent.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/02/bp-earnings-q1.html,Earnings,CNBC

The London-based company said it plans to reduce emissions of CO2 gases by 3.5 million tonnes by 2025 through higher production of gas, the least polluting fossil fuel, reducing leakage of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and limiting flaring of excess gas. BP also plans to invest up to $500 million per year on renewable energies such as solar, wind and power storage. As a result, BP said it plans to keep net emissions from its operations stable between 2015 and 2025. The company uses its 2015 emissions of 51.2 million tonnes of CO2 as a baseline. “We now know that a race to renewables will not be enough. To deliver significantly lower emissions every type of energy needs to be cleaner and better,” Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said in a statement. Dudley has led calls for the energy sector to play a leading role in the transition towards low-carbon energy following a landmark 2015 Paris agreement to limit global warming by the end of the century. He nevertheless said that expected growth in demand for energy means oil and gas companies such as BP will have to invest in new production while slowly growing a low carbon business. BP’s near-term targets contrast with ambitions that rival Royal Dutch Shell outlined last November to halve emissions from its operations as well as from fuel it sells by 2050, known as scope 3 emissions. BP’s reduction targets do not include scope 3. The company planned to grow its production by 900,000 barrels per day of oil and gas between 2015 and 2021.

482,2018-04-30,2018,4.0,30,Marianna Parraga,"BP eyes upcoming oil auctions in Brazil, Mexico: Latam chief","HOUSTON (Reuters) - Oil major BP Plc is closely following oil auctions in Brazil and Mexico, which are expected to announce new awards later this year, to decide whether to submit bids and expand its presence in the region, Felipe Arbelaez, the firm’s chief for Latin America, said on Monday. Rising crude prices and energy reforms in several Latin American nations have reinvigorated the oil majors’ appetite for a region that once imposed nationalizations, forced contract changes and strict rules for foreign investors. More companies are becoming interested in offshore prospects from Brazil to Guyana, which present potential new reserves and could diversify investment portfolios. “Our emphasis in the region right now - in terms of bidding rounds - is in Brazil and Mexico. We are also looking at Argentina, though it is still early,” Arbelaez said. Brazil will receive bids for blocks in its coveted presalt region in June, after awarding majors including Exxon Mobil Corp, BP and Royal Dutch Shell Plc offshore blocks in previous rounds in 2017 and 2018. Brazil’s government also is in negotiations with Petrobras to accept foreign investment in the remaining areas of fields assigned to the state-run oil company. The resulting blocks would be auctioned this year, along with hundreds of areas that were not awarded in previous rounds. For its part, Mexico plans to announce results in September from two onshore rounds, including its first offer of unconventional areas for foreign investment. In Colombia and Uruguay, the investors’ interest has not been as high. The Andean nation has postponed several times the offer for its Sinu-San Jacinto onshore round, while Uruguay received no bids at its third offshore auction in April. The auctions in many Latin American countries come as presidential elections this year increase the political risk because some candidates have promised to slam the brakes on reforms, revise the signed contracts or change fiscal terms. “Every country is different... (The elections) don’t change our perspective in the medium or long terms,” Arbelaez said. BP is trying to increase the number of oil projects it operates in the region, especially in Brazil. In countries including Guyana, Colombia and Suriname, the firm is seeking opportunities to participate in offshore areas. “These countries are reopening for foreign investment. We think that will benefit the countries because they will have a wider number of experienced operators and because they will be capable of better developing and marketing their resources,” he said.

The Jupiter Express carrying about 35,000 tonnes of diesel loaded from BP’s Cherry Point, Washington refinery on June 29 and is currently headed to Botany Bay, New South Wales in Australia, shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon showed. BP declined to comment. Australia imports most of its diesel requirements from Singapore, South Korea and Japan but several refineries undergoing maintenance and prompt demand from India has tightened supply of the fuel in Asia, traders said. “The decision was (likely) made due to far east premium strength, Singapore (cash premium) strength versus bringing a vessel down,” a trader with a North Asian refiner said. The cash differential for diesel with 10-parts-per-million (ppm) sulphur, a grade imported by Australia, rose to a six-month high in early July, Reuters data showed. GO10-SIN-DIF BP last shipped diesel from the United States to Australia in December, a shipbroker said, though such cargo movements were unheard of before that. United States usually ships most of its diesel exports to Europe than Asia due to cheaper freight rates, traders said. But a rise in Singapore cash premiums for diesel has attracted the unusual reverse arbitrage flow of diesel from Europe to Asia, they added. BP has chartered the long-range Nan Lin Wan and Front Antares tankers for loading out of the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp storage and refining hub in mid-July, headed to Asia, traders and shipbrokers said. This could also be prompting the unusual flow of diesel cargo from the United States to Australia, the traders added. “I think going forward, it’s going to be more and more common to see this kind of reverse flows as Asian demand for oil products like jet fuel and diesel is growing phenomenally,” a Singapore-based trader said. But the unusual diesel imports could ease in the third quarter as refineries are expected to return from maintenance and as India’s imports of the fuel taper off due to the start of monsoon rains which typically reduce the need of the fuel in irrigation pumps.

The existing production sharing deal was due to expire in 2024 and talks to extend it have been slow because of disagreements between partners in the BP-led consortium, sources told Reuters earlier this year. [nL8N19L42R] The extension of the Azeri contracts adds to the flurry of deals BP signed in recent weeks, including buying stakes in gas exploration areas off the coast of Mauritania and Senegal, and renewing an onshore oil concession in Abu Dhabi. [nL5N1EE253] BP said the consortium and Azeri state oil firm SOCAR on Friday signed a letter of intent to continue developing the giant Azeri-Chirag-Guneshly (ACG) offshore fields until 2050. It said it had agreed the key commercial terms for the future development while the deal was due to be finalised in the next few months. The shareholders in the consortium include BP, Chevron, INPEX, Statoil, ExxonMobil, TPAO, ITOCHU and ONGC Videsh. “ACG is known as the ‘Contract of the Century’. It is very important to Azerbaijan ... We can now look ahead to many more years of ACG’s success,” the statement quoted SOCAR’s president Rovnag Abdullayev as saying. The existing deal was signed in 1994 and became the first successful agreement between a former Soviet Union republic and oil majors to develop energy resources. BP said the new deal will bring many thousands of jobs in the years ahead. BP came under fire from Azeri President Ilham Aliyev earlier this decade when the country’s leader criticized the oil firm for lower than promised output levels. With current output of 620,000 barrels per day, the fields have produced a total of over 3 billion barrels of oil since the start of the project, with around $33 billion of investment. Their remaining reserves are estimated to contain several more billions of barrels of oil.

The rating agency bumped BP up one notch to A1 and said the London-based company's outlook was positive. Moody's last upgraded BP's long-term issuer rating in 1998, a spokesman said. ""Our decision to upgrade BP to A1 factors in the increased clarity around the size and timing of remaining cash payments linked to the Deep Water Horizon incident, as well as expected improvements to BP's credit metrics and its strong operating performance despite high oil price volatility,"" said Elena Nadtotchi, vice president and senior credit officer at Moody's. The settlement of the Deepwater Horizon fines and clean up costs in 2015 brought BP's pretax bill to more than $62 billion. The company will pay the charge gradually into the 2030s. BP, like other oil companies, slashed spending and costs in the wake of a sharp drop in oil prices from mid-2014. It is aiming to be able to general cashflow at oil prices of $35 to $40 a barrel by the end of the decade. ""BP demonstrated strong operating performance amid high volatility in oil prices,"" according to Moody's. It is set to see a sharp rise in production in the coming years as it starts up eight projects this year, including in Oman and Azerbaijan, the largest number in the company's history in a single year. The company hopes to add 800,000 barrels per day of new production by the end of the decade. ""The positive outlook recognizes that BP's strong business profile may sustain a higher rating and anticipates that the company will continue to deliver strong operating performance in 2017-19, supported by growth and improving profitability of the upstream, and rising contribution from the downstream,"" Moody's said. Of 29 analysts surveyed by Reuters, 14 have 'buy' or 'strong buy' recommendations on BP, and 14 a 'hold' recommendation.

The investment is the largest specific project announcement since March in Vaca Muerta, one of the world’s largest shale formations, as Argentine President Mauricio Macri’s government tries to reduce reliance on gas imports that have strained Argentina’s finances. The provincial government in Neuquen, where Vaca Muerta is located, has agreed to split the Aguada Pichana area into two parts and is also combining it with the Aguada de Castro area, according to a statement. Total will operate the eastern part of Aguada Pichana with a 41 percent stake, where 48 horizontal wells will be drilled through 2021, up from 12 currently. Pan American Energy will operate the western part as well as Aguada de Castro with a 45 percent stake and plans to drill 24 horizontal wells. The investments will double natural gas production in the area to 4.5 million cubic meters per day, up from 2.2 million cubic meters per day currently, Neuquen Governor Omar Gutierrez said at a news conference. Pan American Energy Executive Director Marcos Bulgheroni said lower logistics costs were still needed but added that “the development of Vaca Muerta is on a path of no return.” The partners had already invested $500 million in the areas between 2014 and 2016. In March, Argentina’s Tecpetrol, part of the Techint Group, said it would invest $2.3 billion in the Vaca Muerta shale fields through 2019, marking the biggest announcement related to the formation in years. That investment came after the government said it would gradually lower the price it guarantees for gas drilled from new wells, currently $7.50 per million British thermal units of gas, to encourage investment sooner rather than later. Vaca Muerta contains 308 trillion cubic feet of shale gas and 16.2 billion barrels of shale oil, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The commodity moved lower on Tuesday after reports that Saudi Arabia had produced above its output gap. In June, oil reached a 7-month low on a bearish U.S. inventory report.

Brent was up by 1.5 percent being sold at $48.27 and WTI jumped 1.7 percent being sold at $45.83. BP's Dudley told CNBC that the company will plan for an average of $50 a barrel in the next five years, but as it puts its books in order, it will only need a crude price of $30 a barrel to cover spending and dividends.

The company relinquished its 50 percent stake in a block off the coast of the southern African country because it was adjudged to no longer be commercially attractive. Major oil companies are under pressure from investors to show progress has been made toward covering spending and dividends with cash generation. Further to this, stubbornly low oil and gas prices are causing companies to wrestle with their portfolios in order to become more competitive. BP said Tuesday that the write-off had no impact on cash flow. ""We delivered strong operational performance in the first half of 2017 and have considerable strategic momentum coming into the rest of the year and 2018, with rising production from our new upstream (exploration and production) projects and marketing growth in the downstream (the refining of petroleum crude oil),"" he added. BP currently has one of the highest ""breakeven"" prices among its peers, after a series of acquisitions at the start of the year pushed up its spending plans. The estimated oil price at which BP's upstream assets would offset its costs stands at $60 a barrel, above the market rate of around $50 a barrel. ""I think the most important thing is that there was a very strong cash generation again this quarter from BP,"" Jason Gammel, global integrated oil and gas equity research analyst at Jeffries, told CNBC on Tuesday. ""This is the second quarter in a row where we calculate that the company is covering the cash component of their dividend with free cash flow … I think that's the most important thing to focus on today,"" he added. While Gammel warned he did not envisage BP getting back to ""pre-Macondo"" production levels anytime soon, referring to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, he did say the company appeared to be in the ""very final stages"" of dealing with the economic losses connected to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico disaster.BP's payments related to the Gulf of Mexico settlement are poised to reach between $4.5 billion and $5.5 billion in 2017, while an additional $2 billion is expected to be paid in 2018. The company has so far paid a pre-tax total of $63.2 billion in clean up costs and penalties, Reuters reported. BP's latest figures comfortably surpassed analyst expectations on Tuesday, joining European peers such as Total and Royal Dutch Shell in posting forecast-beating results for the second quarter. Royal Dutch Shell reported last week that its profits were three times larger than over the same period a year earlier. Meanwhile, French oil and gas giant Total also beat expectations on Thursday, posting a 14 percent increase in adjusted net income when compared to the second quarter in 2016.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/01/bp-earnings-q2-2017.html,Earnings,CNBC

The agreement was signed in the southern Iraqi city of Basra, he told a news conference after the signing. Under the deal, BP will boost output capacity from six fields in the Kirkuk region to a total of more than 1 million barrels per day (bpd), three times today’s capacity in the region. The oilfields were returned to Baghdad’s control in October after Iraqi government forces dislodged Kurdish fighters from the area. The minister began talks with BP in October, days after the Kurdish fighters were driven expelled. Oil exports from the region, transported by pipeline to Turkey, were halted after the Iraqi military operation, which was launched in retaliation against an independence referendum held on Sept. 25 by the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). Iraq plans to start trucking crude from Kirkuk to Iran, but the road to the border has yet to be secured from attacks by Islamic State insurgents. BP had agreed in 2013 to help Baghdad halt a sharp decline in output from Kirkuk. The KRG then took control of the Kirkuk region in 2014, when the Iraqi army collapsed in the face of Islamic State’s sweeping advance in northern and western Iraq. The Kurdish move prevented the fields from falling into the hands of the militants. Kirkuk is one of the biggest and oldest oilfields in the Middle East, estimated to contain about 9 billion barrels of recoverable oil, according to BP. BP has provided technical assistance in the past to North Oil to help redevelop the Kirkuk field. Iraq, the second biggest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries behind Saudi Arabia, has capacity to produce almost 5 million bpd, but now produces 4.45 million bpd to comply with an OPEC-led deal to curb supplies. Most of Iraq’s crude is produced from areas managed by the central government of Baghdad, in the south, and exported from southern ports on the Gulf. The KRG exports about 300,000 bpd of crude from northern Iraq through a pipeline across Turkey.

495,2016-07-26,2016,7.0,26,Karolin Schaps,British oil major BP pursues new projects despite profit miss,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP will forge ahead with at least three more new projects this year, its CEO said, despite the British oil major reporting a 45 percent drop in second-quarter earnings that prompted a cut in its 2016 investment budget to below $17 billion. Tuesday’s results missed expectations, with analysts surprised by higher corporate charges, including administrative costs relating to Gulf of Mexico oil spill liabilities, and a lower contribution from BP’s stake in Russian oil producer Rosneft. Rivals Shell, Statoil, Total and Eni also report second-quarter numbers this week, sharpening the focus on Tuesday’s drop in crude oil prices towards $44 a barrel, well short of the $60 previously cited as the level at which oil majors can break even. Though BP chief Bob Dudley acknowledged that the global oil glut’s impact on refining margins and revenue continues to make for a challenging environment, he said that capital expenditure plans have been helped by a drop in associated costs. “We’re going to choose our projects really carefully and the cost reductions and re-engineering of the projects has really brought them down to what I think is a very attractive (price range),” Dudley told Reuters. Dudley said that BP could make another three final investment decisions this year, having already signed off on the expansion of its Tangguh liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant in Indonesia and the Atoll offshore gas project in Egypt. A gas project in India, the second phase of the Mad Dog deepwater oil field in the Gulf of Mexico and a Trinidad project could all get the green light, he said. BP’s projects pipeline is expected to add 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day by the end of 2017, with a further 300,000 bpd by the end of the decade. Shares in the company fell 2.5 percent to 429 pence by 1128 GMT, but RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria said: “We think continued cost and capex deflation reads positively for the sector.” Second-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, BP’s most-watched profit measure, was $720 million, down from $1.3 billion in the same period last year and $120 million below an analyst consensus provided by the company. BP’s refining margins hit a six-year low for the second quarter and the company said they would remain under significant pressure in the coming months. It continues to reduce costs and now expects full-year capital expenditure to come in below the previous target of $17 billion target, saying that its 2017 investments could drop to as low as $15 billion if crude prices remain weak. “I don’t think BP should go below that because then you start to take away from important growth,” Dudley said. Total costs for the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill, which killed 11 workers, has reached $62 billion but the majority of claims have now been settled. BP maintained its quarterly dividend at 10 cents a share, reassuring investors in a sector valued for its consistent payouts.

496,2017-10-18,2017,10.0,18,,Kirkuk: Iraq calls on BP to 'quickly' develop disputed oilfields,"Iraq urged BP to help develop oilfields in the disputed city of Kirkuk on Wednesday, after central government forces loyal to Baghdad swept through the Kurdish-held territory at the start of the week. Iraqi forces began a takeover of almost the entire disputed Kirkuk province Monday, with Kurdish forces retreating to nearby oilfields. The military maneuvers in northern Iraq come after the country's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region voted overwhelmingly in favor of independence in a referendum last month. The vote was subsequently declared illegitimate by Iraq's central government. Baghdad is reportedly seeking to double Kirkuk's oil output to more than 1 million barrels per day (bpd) and has requested the support of Britain's oil major to help achieve this aim. Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi asked BP ""to quickly make plans to develop the Kirkuk oilfields,"" as reported in an oil ministry statement Wednesday.Speaking Wednesday at the Oil and Money conference in London, BP CEO Bob Duley said: ""We know Kirkuk well... and we were doing technical work there up until 2015. But I haven't read these comments or heard from him (Jabar al-Luaibi)."" Herman Wang, OPEC specialist at S&P Global Platts, told CNBC Wednesday that he was unclear regarding the leadership in Kirkuk after peshmerga fighters had left the disputed province. ""There seemed to be some sort of coordinated plan, now who was in charge of this coordinated plan is not that clear to me at this point,"" he said. Iraq is OPEC's second-largest oil producer. Kurdish-controlled areas of Iraq are among the most productive in the country and contain much of its energy infrastructure. BP has estimated that Kirkuk has approximately 9 billion barrels of recoverable oil remaining. Geopolitical tensions in Iraq were supportive to oil prices Wednesday morning. Brent crude rose 0.7 percent to $58.29 a barrel while U.S. oil futures hovered near the $52 level in mid-morning trade.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/18/kirkuk-iraq-calls-on-bp-to-quickly-develop-disputed-oilfields.html,Oil,CNBC

He told CNBC that the oil giant was ""flattered"" to have been asked by Baghdad. In mid-October, Iraq called on BP to help develop oilfields in the disputed — and oil-rich — Kirkuk province after central government forces loyal to Baghdad swept through the Kurdish-held territory. ""With all of these things, you just have to wait, there will be an evolution. There's nothing that's going to happen tomorrow at all, but we are flattered that they would like us to come in and help develop that field,"" BP CEO Bob Dudley told CNBC on Friday. Fighting between central government troops and Kurdish forces has hampered pipeline exports in OPEC's second-biggest producer. Iraq's prime minister rejected an offer to hold talks with Kurdish officials Thursday, after authorities in the semi-autonomous Kurdish region asked lawmakers in Baghdad to ""freeze"" the result of last month's independence referendum. Baghdad has repeatedly insisted September's vote, in which people decisively backed secession, was both illegitimate and illegal. Shortly after the vote, Iraqi Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi, ordered the country's military to retake disputed territories owned by the Kurds — including the region of Kirkuk. The military maneuvers have since sparked clashes that have left dozens dead and injured many more. BP began working in a technical capacity in Iraq's Kurdish region in 2013, before pulling back amid an escalation of geopolitical uncertainty two years later. ""The pipeline goes out through Kurdistan so it is not clear to me but we work and live in a very volatile industry and we are comfortable working in places with political change.

Here are some of the highlights from the earnings: The British oil giant posted third-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, used as a proxy for net profit, of $1.87 billion, beating analysts' projections of $1.58 billion. The firm also announced it would buy back shares over the next three months in order to try to dampen the impact of its scrip dividend program. This is a scheme where a company's cash reserves are converted into new shares. Buying back shares can boost the price of remaining shares, as there would be less in circulation.  ""We are steadily building a track record of delivering on our plans and growing across our businesses,"" Bob Dudley, chief executive at BP, said in a statement shortly after the third-quarter results were announced. ""There is still room for further improvement and we will keep striving to increase sustainable free cash flow and distributions to shareholders,"" he added. The price of oil collapsed from near $120 a barrel in June 2014 due to weak demand, a strong dollar and booming U.S. shale production. OPEC's reluctance to cut output was also seen as a key reason behind the fall. But, the oil cartel soon moved to curb production — along with other oil producing nations - in late 2016.

501,2019-02-11,2019,2.0,11,"Nadine Awadalla, Aidan Lewis","Egypt to see gas boost from BP fields, Zohr as Cairo returns to export market","CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt’s gas output will get a boost this year as the country’s huge Zohr field nears peak production and with $1.8 billion in investment from BP, officials said on Monday, as Egypt returns to export markets and positions itself as a regional hub. Egypt hopes to leverage its strategic location and well-developed infrastructure to become a key international trading and distribution center for gas, a potentially remarkable turnaround for a country that spent about $3 billion on annual liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports as recently as 2016. It has made a series of big discoveries in recent years, including Zohr, the largest gas field in the Mediterranean, helping to draw back investors that had pulled away after a 2011 uprising led to mounting debt payments. “What we have achieved in only three years has started to attract the attention of everybody — everybody in oil and gas industry, financial organizations ... everyone is looking to Egypt with interest,” Petroleum Minister Tarek El Molla told an energy forum in Cairo. Egypt is now hoping to tap long underutilized liquefaction plants, where gas is turned into LNG, to export supplies across the Mediterranean along with that of its neighbors, like Israel, which said it would pipe gas to Egypt later this year. Egypt imported its final natural gas shipment last September, and said it will begin exporting to Jordan this year, though the exact level of shipments and timeline is still unclear. Its domestic production level stands at about 6.6 billion cubic feet per day. BP said in September it will spend about $1.8 billion this year getting several fields online, making Egypt its largest investment destination worldwide for a second year running. “For the last two years in a row we’ve invested more money in Egypt than in any other country,” BP CEO Bob Dudley said at the conference. “So this is a deep, deep commitment to Egypt.” Total production at BP’s West Nile Development will soar to nearly 1.4 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) after the project’s third field, Raven, comes online. About 700 million cubic feet per day will come online by April from the first two, Giza and Fayoum, Molla said. The country’s top gas asset, Zohr, discovered by Eni in 2015, will near peak production of about 3 bcfd from 2.1 billion currently by the end of 2019, Molla said, further boosting potential export capacity. Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne said the French oil major is considering developing downstream petrochemicals in Egypt after having acquired a stake in Idku, one of its two liquefaction plants. Eni, which owns a stake in the country’s other liquefied natural gas plant in Damietta along with Spain’s Gas Natural has said the long idle plant should restore operations this year. “There is no date, however there is a strong interest for all involved parties in having Damietta restart as soon as possible,” said Eni Chief Midstream Gas and Power Office Massimo Mantovani. Molla said results of two exploration tenders held last year for 27 blocks would be announced during the three-day forum, and that it had seen “high turnout” from international companies. He said about 80 percent of arrears to international oil companies had been paid, but did not specify the amount left. In July they stood at $1.2 billion.

""I think most people would say the Gulf region, I actually say Venezuela,"" Bob Dudley, CEO of BP told CNBC at the Abu Dhabi Petroleum Exhibition & Conference, when asked about geopolitics and the oil sector. ""I think Venezuela is just defying economic gravity and I think that's a real wild card,"" he added. Venezuela, an OPEC nation and one of the biggest oil producers in the world, is starting a debt renegotiation with foreign investors on Monday. However, it is not clear that President Nicolas Maduro will succeed in these talks, increasing the risk of debt default. According to Reuters, Maduro said Sunday that ""default will never reach Venezuela"" and the country has ""a clear strategy"" — to renegotiate and refinance the foreign debt. Venezuela aims to restructure about $60 billion in bonds. Caracas has struggled to refinance its debt because U.S. banks cannot buy new Venezuelan bonds due to sanctions imposed by U.S. The Venezuelan economy has been in recession for four years, where food shortages, the lack of U.S. dollars and the depreciation of its own currency, has sent inflation soaring. According to Reuters, using data from the opposition-led congress, prices quickened to 248.6 percent in the first seven months of 2017. There is no published official data. Dudley from BP believes that this situation deserves more of a spotlight than the instability in the Middle East, where the Saudi Arabia-Iran relationship has become more fragile. The former has in fact urged the international community to slap fresh sanctions on Iran, accusing it of supporting terrorism. Also on Monday, the European Union imposed new sanctions on Venezuela, prohibiting arms sales, setting up a system for freezing assets and announcing new travel restrictions on some government officials. The EU said that the sanctions could be reversed if Venezuela returns to greater democracy. Speaking earlier to CNBC on the sidelines of the Abu Dhabi Petroleum Exhibition & Conference, the CEO of the Mexican oil firm PEMEX told CNBC that he hopes the relationship with the United States will grow in the energy sector. ""Energy was not part of NAFTA (The North American Free Trade Agreement), because it was a closed sector,"" Jose Antonio Gonzalez Anaya, CEO of PEMEX told CNBC. ""Now that's open, I hope the relationship can only grow,"" he added. Mexico and the U.S. have been embroiled in a tense political fight since President Donald Trump took office. Trump said last month that the 23-year-old trade deal between the U.S., Canada and Mexico will come to an end, if they cannot agree on how to reform it. ""We have to protect our workers. So we'll see what happens with NAFTA, but I've been opposed to NAFTA for a long time, in terms of the fairness of NAFTA,"" Trump said during a visit to Canada.

Shell has agreed to exit the Majnoon field in southern Iraq and hand over its operation to the state-run Basra Oil Co. by the end of June 2018, according to two Iraqi oil officials. “BP and Italy’s Eni have approached the oil ministry last month to show interest in developing Majnoon after Shell exits the field,” an oil official close to Majnoon operations said.

""We're in the oil and gas industry, so we're not allowed to have a point of view. The politically correct thing is for us to say this. But the reality is our policymakers or politicians either need to get more educated or be more honest, one or the other,"" Dudley said at the Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition Conference (ADIPEC). The line came during a CNBC-moderated panel called ""Global Business Leaders - Driving growth"" which also featured the CEOs of other oil and gas multinationals. Executives discussed the challenges of a changing energy landscape, pressures to curb carbon emissions and meeting the world's energy demands. A common theme was frustration with the demands of developed world governments to meet certain climate change targets, which the oil CEOs viewed as often incompatible with the developing world's energy needs. ""There will be no energy growth in Europe, no growth in energy in North America, but there will be 2 billion more people on the planet and they won't be coming from those places,"" Dudley stressed. ""Something like 1.4 billion people without access to electricity, and 1 billion or more don't even have access to cooking fuels. And our policymakers, too often, who are focused on waiting for the next election in 18 months, are trying to impose things that actually (according to) the law of big numbers will not work."" Indeed, the OPEC outlook to 2040 sees the energy sector increasingly dependent on developing nations, particularly China and India, based on expanding population estimates. ""There is still a heavy dependence on oil and gas, and that's why we think oil and gas will still remain our core business, and not forgetting these new energies of course,"" said Tan Sri Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin, CEO of Malaysian multinational Petronas at the same panel, describing a 20-year forecast in which oil and gas will still constitute 45 to 53 percent of the energy mix. OPEC expects oil and gas to continue supplying more than half of global energy needs by 2040, according to its 2017 World Oil Outlook report. The International Energy Agency has similarly reported that oil consumption and demand is projected to remain strong into the 2040s, despite a diversifying energy mix. Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne echoed the BP executive's sentiments. ""I think there is something wrong in all this narrative today, because we are dominated by a sort of 'sanctified agreement',"" he said, referencing the Paris Climate Accord's pledge to keep a global temperature rise this century below 2 percent. ""(In) developed countries ... we are over-impacted by the vision in our countries,"" Pouyanne continued. ""But when you go to emerging countries, the debate is not fair. These countries are absolutely striving for energy because it's fundamental for economic and social development. And we are wrong in our Western world to believe that we are right on everything, and in fact on energy they are much more realistic and pragmatic that we are."" ""We have to be pragmatic and not believe that we have to give lessons to everybody. Because we are in the energy world, we must also help these politicians to face the reality, and not accept just to be accused because we do oil and gas.

508,2017-12-29,2017,12.0,29,,"Apple apologizes for slower batteries, joins Facebook, BP, Volkswagen","Following an uproar over recent reports that Apple slows down older iPhones, the company released a 766-word statement on Thursday, apologizing to its customers. Apple said it would never ""intentionally shorten the life of any product,"" but acknowledged that users of earlier generations of phones could experience longer launch times for apps and other performance reductions to improve power management. ""We apologize,"" the company said. ""There's been a lot of misunderstanding about this issue, so we would like to clarify and let you know about some changes we're making."" Apple said it is slashing $50 off the out-of-warranty iPhone battery replacement for the next year, bringing the cost down to $29 for anyone with an iPhone 6, or any newer model, starting in late January. And a software update that will hit early next year will give users more insight into battery life. As the most valuable company in the world, with a market capitalization of $898 billion (which fell to $872 billion after Friday's market open), any kerfuffle involving Apple's flagship product is a big deal. But as far as business scandals requiring formal apologies go, other companies have had it much worse. Here are some of the most notable corporate regrets of the year and some really big ones from years past, listed in reverse chronological order. Whistleblowers had revealed sexual harassment within Uber's ranks. Alphabet's Waymo was suing Uber over intellectual property theft. And investors had forced co-founder Travis Kalanick to resign as CEO. Following all that chaos, the company announced last month that hackers had stolen the personal data of 57 million Uber users, including hundreds of thousands of drivers in the U.S. The breach happened in October 2016, and Uber had paid the hacker $100,000 to destroy the wrongfully attained data. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, Kalanick's successor, apologized. ""None of this should have happened, and I will not make excuses for it,"" he said. ""While I can't erase the past, I can commit on behalf of every Uber employee that we will learn from our mistakes. We are changing the way we do business, putting integrity at the core of every decision we make and working hard to earn the trust of our customers."" Oath, Yahoo's new owner, said a 2013 data breach impacted all 3 billion user accounts, not 1 billion, as the company had said earlier. Marissa Mayer, Yahoo's former CEO, offered an in prepared testimony before the U.S. Senate. ""First and foremost, I want to reiterate how sorry I am for these incidents,"" she said. ""We worked hard over the years to earn our users' trust, and we fought hard to preserve it. As CEO, these thefts occurred during my tenure, and I want to sincerely apologize to each and every one of our users."" The credit reporting company, in September, announced a affecting up to 143 million U.S. consumers. Ex-CEO Richard Smith, who retired after the hack, testified before the U.S. House of Representatives and apologized for his role in the matter. ""As CEO I was ultimately responsible for what happened on my watch,"" Smith said. ""Equifax was entrusted with Americans' private data and we let them down. To each and every person affected by this breach, I am deeply sorry that this occurred."" The personal care brand, owned by Unilever, publicly expressed its regrets for a Facebook campaign that depicted women taking off their shirts to reveal a woman of a different race. That followed an earlier campaign in May, in which the brand promoted custom bottles that were intended to celebrate the diversity of body shapes, but became the butt of jokes on Twitter. Following the ad in October, Dove posted the following tweet: Facebook had been under fire for spreading fake news, hate speech and allowing Russian-linked groups to run political ads ahead of the U.S. presidential election. Facing increased scrutiny and unable to deny some of Facebook's ongoing problems, CEO Mark Zuckerberg published a general apology on Sept. 30, which marked Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement. ""For those I hurt this year, I ask forgiveness and I will try to be better,"" Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook wall. ""For the ways my work was used to divide people rather than bring us together, I ask forgiveness."" It wasn't the first, nor would it be the last, time that Facebook and its executives would apologize. Just two weeks later, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg apologized for the company's inability to stop Russian-linked ads from interfering with and influencing the 2016 election. ""Things happened on our platform that shouldn't have happened,"" Sandberg told Axios. After a doctor, who refused to give up his seat, was dragged off an overbooked flight headed from Chicago to Louisville, Kentucky, a video of the incident went viral. David Dao, the passenger, was treated for injuries and United Airlines was pushed to apologize. ""The truly horrific event that occurred on this flight has elicited many responses from all of us: outrage, anger, disappointment,"" CEO Oscar Munoz said in a statement. ""I share all of those sentiments, and one above all: my deepest apologies for what happened. Like you, I continue to be disturbed by what happened on this flight and I deeply apologize to the customer forcibly removed and to all the customers aboard. No one should ever be mistreated this way."" After years of promoting its ""clean diesel"" vehicles, Volkswagen was found to be skirting emissions tests with ""defeat devices"" that allowed cars to pass tests in labs, while going on to spew pollution on the road. In addition to the environmental impact, car owners and dealers couldn't sell off ""Dieselgate"" vehicles. CEO Martin Winterkorn issued a video apology, in German, as the company came under intense regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. Here's part of the translated statement: ""Ladies and gentlemen, many millions of people around the world trust our brands, our cars and our technologies. I am endlessly sorry that we disappointed this trust. I apologize sincerely to our customers and the regulatory agencies and the public for the misbehavior. Please believe me that we will do everything to undo the damage that was done. And we will do everything to win back your trust step by step."" Winterkorn was forced to resign within weeks of his apology. Several employees were convicted in the U.S. for involvement in the decadeslong emissions scandal. The internet giant apologized after a user of the observed that some photos of himself and another person were put into an automatically generated album entitled ""Gorillas."" ""We're appalled and genuinely sorry that this happened,"" a Google spokesperson told USA Today. ""We are taking immediate action to prevent this type of result from appearing. There is still clearly a lot of work to do with automatic image labeling, and we're looking at how we can prevent these types of mistakes from happening in the future."" Netflix faced a huge investor and customer backlash after announcing a price hike and plans to split its streaming and DVD-rental businesses into two brands. Qwikster would be the name of the mail-order unit. CEO Reed Hastings backtracked and apologized for the way he handled customer communications. Netflix lost 2 million subscribers and its stock dropped by 75 percent. ""I messed up, I owe everyone an explanation,"" Hastings wrote in a letter. ""I slid into arrogance based upon past success."" He went on to say that he ""should have personally given a full justification to our members of why we are separating DVD and streaming, and charging for both."" Hastings has long since been forgiven. The stock is up 21-fold in the past six years. The pharmaceutical company was hit with numerous recalls in 2009 and 2010 related to nonprescription medications, including Tylenol, Benadryl and Motrin. One recall was for bacteria contamination, another for mildew-like odor and yet another for contamination of Children's Tylenol. ""I know that we let the public down,"" former Johnson & Johnson CEO William Weldon told the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. ""We did not maintain our high-quality standards. Children do not have access to our important medicines. I accept full accountability for the problems, and I will take full accountability for fixing them."" In April 2010, an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico killed 11 people and caused more than 4 million barrels of oil to shoot out of the well one mile below the surface of the ocean. The oil spilled for 87 days and decimated much of the Gulf Coast's tourist economy. Tony Hayward, who was CEO at the time, apologized in late May of that year for the ordeal but created controversy by implying he too was a victim. ""I'd like my life back,"" Hayward said in a TV interview. Days later, he apologized for the apology. ""I apologize, especially to the families of the 11 men who lost their lives in this tragic accident,"" he wrote on Facebook. ""Those words don't represent how I feel about this tragedy."" The financial crisis featured plenty of blame to go around. As financial stocks were recovering in late 2009, while much of the country was still feeling the pain of the recession, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein publicly apologized for his bank's role in issuing cheap and easy credit. He pledged $500 million over five years to help small businesses recover. ""We participated in things that were clearly wrong and have reason to regret,"" Blankfein said at a conference in New York, ""We apologize."" -- CNBC's Anita Balakrishnan contributed to this report.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/29/apple-apologizes-for-slower-batteries-joins-facebook-bp-volkswagen.html,Tech,CNBC

The finds were made in summer 2017 in wells drilled near the Shetland Islands and in the central North Sea. One is fully owned by BP while the other is a joint venture with Chevron and Shell. BP North Sea Regional President Mark Thomas said Wednesday that the data of both new wells is under evaluation and at least one of the two could potentially be tied into existing infrastructure. He added that that the wider area off the Scottish coast now looked ""refreshed and revitalized"" for energy extraction. ""We expect to double production to 200,000 barrels a day by 2020 and keep producing beyond 2050,"" he added. After a two-year downturn in the oil market, North Sea operations are showing signs of resurgence after the price of crude recently pushed back above $70 a barrel. In January, Shell announced it was to build its first new North Sea installation in three decades and a number of private equity firms have taken over production fields vacated by oil majors. According to Oil and Gas UK, total production has risen year-on-year since 2013, while costs per barrel have been slashed as firms look for efficiencies. In its December 2017 report, the industry group added that up to $5.5 billion worth of new capital projects could be approved in 2018, the highest level in five years. Following BP's announcement, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in Scotland said it was ""perverse"" to double production of North Sea energy in the face of climate change.

""This is the best earnings we have had in recent history... All of the businesses are firing on all cylinders,"" CEO Bob Dudley told CNBC on Tuesday.The oil giant posted fourth-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, used as a proxy for net profit, of $2.1 billion, beating analysts' projections of $1.9 billion. On a yearly basis, BP's profits more than doubled to $6.2 billion in 2017, up from $2.6 billion in 2016. Meanwhile, full-year production rose 2.47 million barrels per day in 2017, soaring 12 percent when compared to 2016.BP's latest figures come amid a rapidly improving environment for big energy firms, with oil prices skyrocketing 50 percent since the middle of last year. International benchmark Brent crude has recovered strongly in recent months and reached a multi-year high of $70 a barrel last month. There are also signs the oil market is rebalancing, particularly as allied producers continue with an agreement to limit output. BP became the first European oil and gas company to resume share buybacks after a three-year downturn Tuesday. The move is a clear signal of improving sentiment for the oil major, after a slump in oil prices and as it tackles a $65 billion bill for penalties and clean-up costs linked to the deadly 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill.

Indecision at the highest levels of Saudi Arabia's government is reportedly playing a major role in holding up the planned flotation of the world's largest oil producer. Saudi Aramco, currently a private company owned by the government in Riyadh, is aiming for an IPO that could raise about $100 billion and attract a valuation in the range of $1 trillion to $2 trillion later this year. But the process has dragged on as key aspects of the share sale remain unsettled. When Dudley was asked whether he believed Saudi Aramco's IPO was on track to take place in the second half of 2018, he replied: ""I don't know, I mean they say it will. I know there's lots of preparation work going on. I think little dislocations in the market will make them think again."" ""The big questions are if they do, when? And where would they list? I think that debate seems to me to be alive and well,"" he said. The IPO is the centerpiece of Saudi Arabia's plan to diversify its oil-dependent economy. It also stands to create a huge windfall for the army of bankers and lawyers involved in the offering. Meanwhile, Saudi officials have claimed preparatory work regarding the IPO has been completed. However, some key issues — such as where to list — rest with the government. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is believed to favor listing Saudi Aramco in New York, while officials, including Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, have reportedly said London could be a better fit. Hong Kong is also in contention. Another option is a Saudi listing alongside an international exchange. A domestic listing and a private sale to a strategic investor — possibly from Beijing — is a third possibility.

516,2016-03-07,2016,3.0,7,"Jarrett Renshaw, Jessica Resnick-Ault",Wall St. vets battle BP in fallout over Canada refinery ,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A legal battle between a team of former Wall Street oil traders and behemoth producer BP plc (BP.L) over a remote Canadian refinery sheds rare light on the murky world of crude trading. The first salvo in the previously unreported dispute was fired by BP in December. The oil company demanded, through arbitration, $110 million from the private equity-backed NARL Refining for its alleged failure to properly manage and maximize profits from the Come-by-Chance plant in Newfoundland. NARL filed a counter arbitration claim along with two lawsuits accusing BP - which is the refinery’s sole supplier under a two-year contract - of providing varieties of crude that benefit its trading book but hurt the refinery’s equipment and profits. The dispute could jeopardize the ongoing operation of the 115,000 barrel per day (bpd) refinery. It also exposes a rift in the rough-and-tumble global oil market, where disputes often are handled quietly to avoid compromising long-term relationships or revealing trading strategies. “Disagreements among parties in supply contracts are not uncommon, but we don’t typically see these conflicts out in the open,” said Ed Hirs, an energy economist at the University of Houston. “That’s why these contracts call for disputes to go to arbitration, keeping it out of public view.” BP and NARL Refining declined to comment. Hirs said contracts include negotiated terms that majors such as BP would prefer to keep private. The allegation that BP put its interest over those of a client could also hurt business, he said. The refinery’s operators are SilverPeak Financial Partners, a group of Wall Street veterans, including Neal Shear, who helped build Morgan Stanley’s oil trading division; Kaushik Amin, former chief executive officer of RBS Sempra Commodities and global head of liquid markets for Lehman Brothers; and Harsh Rameshwar from Merrill Lynch Commodities. Although they’re experienced trading oil, they began refining it when they purchased the plant for an undisclosed price from South Korea’s national oil company 18 months ago. They are up against BP, one of the world’s largest producers, which supplies its own refineries and select third-party assets around the globe. The high-stakes feud centers on what is the best slate of crudes to run through Come-by-Chance - and how that should be determined. There are dozens of varieties of crude in the world, each with its own characteristics, and a refinery’s profits and operations can vary widely depending on choice. The dispute began quietly in December with arbitration in New York. BP argued that NARL was failing to live up to the terms of the supply contract, according to court records. Typically, arbitration filings are not public. But the dispute spilled into the open when NARL went to a federal court in New York to seek to freeze the business relationship pending a resolution of the arbitration. The “tolling” contract at issue is a routine arrangement for independent refineries that lack the trading operations and credit lines necessary to operate effectively in the global market. There is no dispute that BP was to supply crude to the refinery and take back roughly 82 percent of the refined fuels, such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, paying NARL a fixed “toll” of $9.45 per barrel on the first 90,000 barrels of oil put through each day. NARL earns a higher profit on oil refined in excess of 90,000 bpd, termed “merchant barrels,” BP says in its arbitration filing. The oil company alleges NARL ran the refinery at more than 90,000 bpd to capitalize on the incentive - even when it was not economically advantageous to do so. This came “at the expense of both the Refinery’s gross margin and [BP’s] legitimate expectations for benefit under the contract,” BP said in court documents. In a counterclaim, NARL seeks to end the contract. Early on, NARL says in court documents, it deferred to BP in managing the crude slate. But as the months rolled on, the new owners say in filings, they began to make decisions independent of BP. NARL alleges that BP made only lesser grades available, resulting in “significant and long-term damage” to refinery equipment, including a vacuum tower that had to be shut down abruptly last the fall. The light crudes contain higher levels of asphaltenes, a tar-like substance that can clog lines and pipes, NARL argued. As evidence, NARL submitted a BP presentation that acknowledged the asphaltenes problem with U.S. domestic crudes, calling it an “industry-wide” issue. In a second federal suit, this one filed in Texas, NARL alleges BP interfered with its plans to secure a hedging program, costing it at least $10 million, and scuppered plans to extend a vital financing deal with Citigroup Energy Canada. NARL says in court filings that BP sent several letters to Citigroup - which is a party to the supply and offtake agreement - falsely accusing the refinery owners of mismanaging the plant; it says the correspondence was in an effort to thwart financing negotiations and impose its will on the refinery owners. BP counters in filings that the supply agreement required them to notify Citigroup of their concerns about NARL’s management of the refinery. Citigroup declined to comment.

517,2016-12-13,2016,12.0,13,Ron Bousso,Slack data management exposed BP to high safety risk: leaked report,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP’s (BP.L) refining operations are exposed to high safety risks that can lead to deadly accidents and pollution as a result of slack data management and a lack of investment, according to a leaked internal report from 2015. The report, co-authored by BP, IBM (IBM.N) and industry consultancy WorleyParsons (WOR.AX), states that the British company’s refining and petrochemical business, known as downstream, is trailing rivals such as Royal Dutch Shell by up to seven years in managing information to reduce safety risks and financial losses. “Inadequate management and use of engineering information has been a root cause or contributing factor” in 15 percent of 500 high-risk incidents reviewed in the report, which was provided by Greenpeace. BP has improved its safety record since the 2010 Deepwater Horizon rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico where 11 people were killed and which led to the largest environmental disaster in U.S. history. BP had no fatalities among its employees in 2014 and 2015 compared with four in 2013 and one in each of the previous two years, according to company data. Among BP contractors, there were three fatalities in 2014 and one in 2015. In comments on the leaked report, BP said it was “committed to safe, reliable and compliant operations. With that in mind, BP regularly conducts internal assessments in an effort to make improvements to its operations”. “This particular report focused on potential enhancements to how BP manages engineering data. It is not an analysis of any operational incidents, and any suggestion that this report indicates BP is wavering from its safety commitment is wrong,” a company spokesman said. The most significant incident recorded by the authors occurred in January 2014 at the 413,500 barrels per day (bpd) Whiting, Indiana refinery which cost BP $258 million in lost production. The incident at the gasoil hydrotreater unit, which removes sulphur from oil, was due to “multiple deficiencies in engineering information management”. At the Hull petrochemical plant in northern England equipment that was not operated correctly led to losses of $35 million to $45 million. BP’s safety record came in to focus in 2005 when a blast at its Texas City refinery killed 15 workers and injured 180 others. BP was fined $84.6 million by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration between 2005 and 2012 for safety rules violations found at the refinery in investigations following the blast. The report said highly material safety risk and financial performance issues remained due to “the lack of refining and petrochemicals-wide direction, governance, coordination and investment”. The upstream segment, which produces oil and gas, has further work to do but is significantly ahead of downstream, the report said, reflecting the big focus BP has placed on safety after the Deepwater Horizon explosion. Greenpeace UK’s senior climate adviser Charlie Kronick said in a statement that “BP’s sloppy approach to a crucial aspect of safety hasn’t changed”. “The same happy-go-lucky attitude that played a role in major accidents in the past is seemingly still reflected in the management of safety information across the oil giant’s operations from rig to refinery.” Reporting by Ron Bousso; editing by Susan Thomas/Ruth Pitchford",http://www.reuters.com/article/bp-safety-idUSL5N1E85Z9,Business News,Reuters

520,2018-02-13,2018,2.0,13,,CNBC Interview with BP CEO Bob Dudley,"SS: Thank you very much indeed for your time. We talked about the excellent return in the form of your numbers last week as well let's talk about how operationally the business is going on- you're here in Egypt as well. Why is Egypt such a good example of where you want to be in the world at the moment? BD: Believe it or not Steve we invested more money in capital last year in Egypt than any other country in the world. So people are very surprised about that we've been here for 50 years, we're producing lots of gas natural gas. New projects another one came on today. We've been in the Gulf of Suez with oil for a long, long time. It's just sort of woven into the fabric of the building of BP. So it's good to be here. SS: But in terms of the amount of discoveries that are available in a country such as Egypt and when we talk about products that are getting much harder to find it's getting much harder to find. And of course Eni has had a lot of success here, you've had success here as well. Is there are a lot of gas and oil that you think is not so difficult to find in less difficult political areas at the moment still? BD: Well this is the energy story here is vital to the success and the stability of Egypt and it's got a nearly 100 million people, it's a growing young population it needs natural gas. So this is really for the Egyptian market and the returns on this investment are very reasonable. So the government has worked with us through ups and downs. It's been an interesting country to work in for 50 years. It's really important for us. SS: How difficult is it to work with any country that's had such a big change from 2011 and 2013, 2015. All big dates in recent history as well. You just had to ride all that out though. BD: That's right. Never missed a day of production because we've been here for 50 years. We've got great Egyptian nationals here. In fact they work all over the world with BP and men and women great women here in Egypt. I mean it's just really a very professional place. Very enthusiastic. And the governments have been good but this government is actually great. President on down has always said I'm going to cut through the red tape. Tell me what needs to be done. It's excellent. The Prime Minister, Energy Minister, all of them one team. So that's really rare. Now in a world where a government just works to move things fast quickly helps track. SS: What about elsewhere in the Middle East at the moment. Iraq is somewhere where you course you've always had such huge production in the south and right at the height of the crisis you said you you believe that production was very safe. Now you're looking to areas that are more contentious as well. Rosneft as well of course your collaboration with them, they're looking at Kirkuk and areas that are previously controlled by the KRG as well. Is this a tricky political area for BP to get into? BD: Well if you think back over the last four years Iraq has been in a lot of had a lot of turbulence so let's put it that way. It's now getting its feet back on the ground it wants to attract investment. They're talking to us about Kirkuk where we've been working with them and turned it off for a while during the difficult years. So it's a field we know we have a long history there and Rosneft is working up in the north, north Iraq I don't even call it Kurdistan in northern Iraq. So it's it's not a given that we work together but there's something there about bringing stability to the region, maybe. SS: Do you have concerns about operating in such areas that it could flare up again but potentially? BD: You know this is a question we get asked a lot. You look back at the history of not only BP but other countries I think about the oil industry went into Angola in the middle of the Civil War. Azerbaijan, we were in there through several changes and coups. You know it takes long term commitment. The world forgets that that's what oil and gas companies do. And it has to be safe or people won't go there. But we have a history of working in places that most people would say why would you do that? SS: In terms of the broader stability of the markets moment some of the geniuses on Wall Street are now questioning the supply and demand dynamics saying they're not sure that some of the fundamentals that have got us to high 60s for brent can be maintained going forward – what's your thought? BD: Before I do that I'm going to clarify one thing I just said because I do not want to imply that Azerbaijan and Angola are not stable I'm thinking back 20 years and that's really important because they're very stable places. SS: That's fair enough. So in terms of the price sustainability at current levels? BD: I think it got over 70 I think I think 72 a few weeks ago that felt very high to me our fundamentals seemed or were planning on now at the end of the decade between fifty and sixty five dollars a barrel. Stock levels have come down tremendously over the last three years. The shales will turn themselves back on to a point. So I think we're in a range where the shales will be a shock absorber on the upside and the downside very comfortable where oil prices are as we project out not just this year but I think… SS: You don't think shale is going to ruin the party and just get a little bit overexcited over produce at these kind of current levels? BD: I have to say in the last year I've seen discipline come back into the shales so not just about cash returns and actually people getting a return on capital so you can see the rig count going up. I'm sure production will go up but I think it will also be moderated. The U.S. is such a fast response to the marketplace like no other place in the world. SS: We've been speaking to Mr. Barkindo here as well here in Egypt and people get very excited when Mr. Barkindo speaks to the shale producers and thinks oh can anything happen there as well. But realists would suggest perhaps it's never going to happen. The U.S. is never going to get involved, or are they? BD: No I think there are thousands of companies operating in the U.S. There's not going to be a market mechanism that's from a regulatory standpoint that will tell people what to do. It will be the market that will respond. And I think we saw that the last downturn and I think we're going to see it again and prices get too high over a little bit and come back down. I think we're seeing a big temperature moderator on the world. SS: So they will self regulate rather than regulating in cohorts with the likes of OPEC and others. BD: Absolutely. That's right. Including the big companies. I mean we can't get involved with reducing production for market mechanisms. I mean we work in OPEC countries so we're curtailed here and there, but in terms of coordination and managing the oil price, no way. SS: You got yourself back involved in the Brexit debate I hear as well - some comments you made may or may not been taken out of context as well. So just for our viewers as well, how do you think Mrs May is doing in negotiations? They're very tricky negotiations. Is she doing the right thing by keeping her cards close to her chest? BD: And that's a good question. I mean I'm sympathetic to the Prime Minister for everyone wanting to know every move she's going to make. I mean you're in the oil and gas you negotiate all the time constantly in negotiations. You don't do them publicly. So I think everyone should take a deep breath and there are people that you know want to report on everything every day. That's not realistic. And in my experience negotiators don't come together until closer to a deadline. So, I think it's unrealistic for her to negotiate in public. I think that's not good for the country actually. SS: So your message to people who want to know every detail just just take a step back and let it get on with it. BD: I think that's right. I mean I think that's right. And you know people will put things try to negotiate for her whatever. But I think this is, it's a really important time for Britain in getting this right is really important and expecting everything to be out there for public debate on every point. Actually it's not in Britain's interest in my experience. SS: I know what a huge international company but in terms of the importance of Great Britain you see of course your headquarters in London as well full commitment from BP to remain headquartered in London regardless or actually conditional on what happens in the negotiations? BD: No no we're deeply committed. It's a great British company that's been around for a century. Absolutely. BP is there. I think I think it's not for me to speak for Britain by the way of the negotiations so nobody students understand that for BP, deeply committed to Britain, we will be around for a.

Dudley also provided a long-term forecast. Some experts are predicting electric vehicles and other technologies will bite into oil demand in the decades ahead. In its annual outlook BP said peak oil demand will be reached sometime in the late 2030s, but Dudley said he expects oil demand to be still over 100 million barrels a day in 2040.

522,2018-01-17,2018,1.0,17,Jessica Resnick-Ault,Mexico tops BP retail growth plans in coming years,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BP is expanding its retail presence with plans to open 3,000 branded retail stations globally in the next five years, half in Mexico, as that market becomes increasingly open to international business. The company already has over 100 retail outlets in Mexico, many operated by distributors that previously worked for Mexico’s state-owned oil company Pemex. Energy reforms ended Pemex’s nearly 80-year monopoly several years ago and opened Mexico’s gasoline stations to international investment from the likes of Exxon Mobil Corp, Valero Energy Corp and Andeavor. Trading firm Glencore announced plans last year to start importing fuel for Mexico’s domestic market. “We are looking at all different kinds of operations there,” Rick Altizer, BP senior vice president of sales and marketing said on Wednesday. He said they are open to waterfront terminals, rail operations or other logistical assets to supply its stations. BP is also in the process of opening 10 stores in the U.S. Northeast under the Amoco brand, which it had previously retired. The Amoco label allows BP to expand in areas already saturated with BP stations, and appeals to customer nostalgia for the older label, Altizer said, speaking at an Amoco station in Pelham, New York. The label will also be used in other parts of the country. The company expects global demand growth of 2.4 percent this year and 1.7 percent in 2019 even as automotive efficiency improves, he said.

523,2018-10-24,2018,10.0,24,Esha Vaish,Volvo Cars invests in BP-backed charging firm to lure electric buyers,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Volvo is investing in a startup called FreeWire whose rapid charging systems for electric cars are being installed across BP gasoline stations in Europe this year. Fast charging is a crucial factor in luring customers to electric cars, reflected in moves across the sector. BMW, Daimler, Ford and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) for instance have jointly pledged to open 400 ultra-fast charging stations in Europe by 2020, aiming to close the gap with Tesla. Yet Volvo, owned by China’s Geely Holding [GEELY.UL] and whose XC40 sport utility vehicle will be its first all-electric offering in a strategy to generate half of its sales annually from fully electric cars by 2025, has said it does not see itself owning service or charging stations. Through its Volvo Cars Tech Fund, the Swedish company said it had bought a stake in FreeWire, though it gave no further details. The fund’s CEO Zaki Fasihuddin said Volvo expected an already visible shortage of charging points to grow in magnitude as a wave of electric cars hits the streets in five years. “With electrification there’s going to be a lot of pressure not only to build infrastructure, but also to help consumers get over the range anxiety they feel,” Fasihuddin told Reuters. “We think FreeWire is attacking that problem is a good way.” Fasihuddin said Volvo’s investment would allow it to play an influential role in designing products with FreeWire and to work with BP, which invested $5 million in FreeWire in January. “If you look at the possibility of piloting an innovation, (BP’s involvement) just makes it all the more possible because we get to utilize our and BP’s retail networks and that gives us a bigger, global sandbox to play in,” Fasihuddin said.

524,2017-02-28,2017,2.0,28,"Karolin Schaps, Ron Bousso",BP lifts outlook for core oil business after cost cuts,"LONDON (Reuters) - British oil major BP (BP.L) lifted the outlook for its core oil and gas divisions on Tuesday, saying it would be able to balance its books with crude prices as low as $35 to $40 a barrel by 2021 thanks to its tough spending cuts. BP said its upstream business, which includes its main oil and gas production fields, is expected to generate free cash flow of $13 billion to $14 billion by 2021, nearly double an outlook presented last year of $7 billion to $8 billion by 2020. The refining and marketing business, known as downstream, is expected to generate $9 billion to $10 billion of free cash flow by 2021, BP said. The oil major, which was forced to raise billions of dollars from asset sales to pay for the clean-up of its 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, made around $7 billion in cost cuts last year by tightening investments, cutting staff numbers and through depreciation in service costs. “We expect this combination of continued cost discipline with the growing cash flow from our core businesses will steadily drive down the cash balance point of the business,” BP Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary said. “Over the next five years we expect this to fall to around $35-40 a barrel for the group overall.” Earlier this month, BP lifted this year’s break-even oil price to $60 a barrel because it is investing more in new projects. BP’s shares were up 0.4 percent at 1513 GMT, slightly outperforming the sector index .SXEP which was up 0.2 percent.

525,2018-09-14,2018,9.0,14,"Dmitry Zhdannikov, Julia Payne, Amanda Cooper","BP, Vitol go head to head in West African crude trading","LONDON (Reuters) - Oil major BP has clashed with rival Vitol in the once-languid West African crude market, buying up cargoes and taking a big derivative position that may have raised costs for European refiners. The West African crude market typically sees cargoes of Nigerian and Angolan change hands in back-to-back deals outside the Platts window, a system widely used by the industry to price crude. Pricing agency S&P Global Platts sets key oil benchmarks for the market. New trading opportunities arose from August, when broker Sunrise started the first derivative for Nigeria’s four largest crude oil grades - Bonny Light, Forcados, Qua Iboe and Bonga - mirroring derivatives trading in the North Sea. The derivatives, known as contracts for differences (CFDs), allow traders to bet on whether premiums of the four Nigerian grades versus the Brent benchmark will rise or fall. The CFDs, also known as swaps, can be used to hedge against price fluctuations during the voyage of a physical cargo to a consumer, which can take weeks. But CFDs can also be used to take a speculative position. According to five traders familiar with the developments, who asked not to be named because they are not allowed to speak to the media, BP quietly built a long position of up to 10 million barrels in the African CFDs contracts in August, betting the premium of the grades to Brent will rise in September. Against BP in the paper market were six trading desks, including trading giant Vitol, which took the opposite side of the bet and went short CFDs, betting that African grades’ premiums to Brent would fall, according to trading sources. The paper deals were done on a back-to-back basis with only BP, Vitol and five other companies aware of the developments. BP said it does not comment on trading positions. “However, BP welcomes the introduction of the new West African swap to provide greater transparency and aid price discovery in the West African crude market,” it said on Friday. The trades took place in what has long been a regulatory gray area. London’s Financial Conduct Authority, which does not regulate London trading in the West African crude market, but does oversee the UK Brent crude benchmark, declined to comment. BP does not produce oil in Nigeria and has not been a large trader of Nigerian oil in recent years, although it has bought some cargoes for its refining system. After quietly building its paper position in August, BP launched a flurry of bids on the Platts system in September for physical cargoes of Nigerian oil. BP bid for a total of 22 Nigerian cargoes loading between Sept 3-12, a previously unseen volume in the West African crude market, where a whole month can sometimes go without a single public bid or offer in the Platts window. BP’s bidding activity ushered premiums of the African grades against the Brent benchmark to as high as $1.70 per barrel compared to a premium of $1.20 a barrel in August, when BP was building its CFDs position. A difference of 50 cents per barrel would in theory bring a profit of $5 million on a 10-million-barrel CFD position. The rise in premiums in the physical market made BP a big winner on its long position on the CFDs trade, while Vitol was a loser, according to traders. In reaction, Vitol spent over $500 million to buy seven cargoes outside the Platts system from oil majors Total and Shell, paying premiums above $1.70 per barrel, according to three traders familiar with the developments. The trading house then re-sold the cargoes on the Platts system to BP at premiums ranging between $1.55-$1.75 per barrel, effectively accepting a loss on the physical trade but limiting its losses on the CFD side. “Tensions were running huge between BP and Vitol. It was a high stakes game,” said a trader familiar with the development. Vitol declined to comment on the story. S&P Global Platts said it always ensures bids and offers are firm, performable and tradeable and that its price assessments are reflective of market value. “We have seen a marked increase in the past several weeks of transparent information in the West African crude market,” said Jonty Rushforth, senior director at S&P Global Platts. “Alongside the increase in physical information we have seen a growing derivatives market,” he added. “As the importance of that market globally has grown, we have seen the broader market embrace risk management tools related to it.” Market participants said the main losers from the developments in the West African market will be refiners. Nigerian state oil firm NNPC sets its monthly official selling prices (OSP) to long-term crude buyers, mainly refiners, retroactively and based on prices in the Platts system. “This is very bad from a refiners’ perspective. Every seller is now asking high prices and when they show a cargo, all they say is: “If you don’t buy, we’ll just sell to BP,” said a source with a European refiner.

526,2018-04-20,2018,4.0,20,"Peg Howell, petroleum engineer ",Off-shore drilling is still a terrible idea 8 years after BP oil spill,"Eight years ago, on April 20, 2010, BP's exploratory well located just 41 miles off the coast of Louisiana, blew out. The explosion killed 11 people, pumped 210 million gallons of oil into the waters off Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida, and contaminated over 1,100 miles of coastal marshes and beaches. It took 87 days to finally cap the well that we all saw on underwater cameras pumping seemingly endless amounts of crude oil into the Gulf the entire time. It was, as it has since been named, a disaster. In deeply painful and long-lasting ways, the Deepwater Horizon spill showed the industry and the whole country the risks inherent in drilling, just days before the annual Earth Day celebration. Now, less than a decade later, the Trump administration is suggesting we expand the oil industry's access to pristine waters from coast to coast, including opening the Atlantic Ocean to offshore drilling. Worse still, the administration is proposing this offshore drilling free-for-all while also calling for the repeal of the few offshore drilling safety rules that were put in place in response to Deepwater Horizon. As a veteran of the oil industry, the first woman to supervise offshore drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, and a South Carolinian, I cannot help but be baffled by this decision. Communities across the Southeast have boldly rejected drilling off our shores. When the Obama administration first suggested opening the Atlantic to oil and gas development in 2015, the people who live and work here came out overwhelmingly against the plan and called on their elected leaders and the administration to protect our coastal communities and economies from risky offshore drilling. We were able to stop Atlantic drilling in 2016, but once again find ourselves fighting to protect our coast. However, this time, the opposition is even stronger. Now, more than 190 East Coast communities, and tens of thousands of businesses, fishing and trade groups, and tourism associations have come out opposing Atlantic drilling and seismic air gun surveys. In my own state of South Carolina, every mayor in every coastal city and our state capital, as well as our Governor, oppose seismic surveys and drilling. They are Republican and Democrat alike because protecting our coast is not a partisan issue – it's about protecting our livelihood, our health, our ocean, and everything that makes our state and coastal communities special. We know that it doesn't take a catastrophic spill like what we saw in the Gulf of Mexico to ruin our pristine coast. Offshore drilling is a dirty and dangerous industry. There were 2,440 oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico between 1964 and 2015 resulting in a total of over 12 million gallons of oil dumped into the Gulf – excluding the disastrous Deepwater Horizon spill of over 200 million gallons. In 2016 alone, 497 accidents (damages, injuries and spills) involving offshore oil rigs were reported. Human error and hurricane damage to oil and gas infrastructure are leading causes of spills. If the Atlantic Ocean is opened to offshore drilling, it is not a matter of if͟ but when͟ there will be a spill. We cannot afford to let that happen. A recent study by the non-partisan grassroots organization, Stop Offshore Drilling in the Atlantic (SODA), highlighted that over $16 billion was spent by tourists visiting South Carolina's coast in 2017. The analysis determined that the cumulative economic value of coastal tourism direct-spending from 2022 (when the first wells could be drilled) through 2041 could amount to more than $602 billion. This is roughly 25 times the API's best-case estimate of oil industry revenues to South Carolina over the same period. Based on my first-hand experience in this industry, I know there is no way to make offshore drilling work for the Southeast. The onshore infrastructure, pipelines, vessel traffic and pollution that accompanies offshore drilling would devastate our beautiful beaches, healthy marshes and rivers. It would permanently alter dozens of National Wildlife Refuges, National Seashores, state-protected areas, and ecologically important marine areas. And according to the U.S. Navy, offshore drilling would disrupt training and put military readiness at risk. Most importantly, opening our coast to offshore drilling is a forever decision. Once oil companies obtain leases and find commercial quantities of oil and gas, by law, they are entitled to produce from those leases, drill more wells, or sell the property to another operator - forever. We have seen this movie before, off California's coast, where oil companies have produced – and spilled - from Federal leases for over 50 years. The citizens of California began fighting the Federal government after the first Santa Barbara spill in 1969 and are still fighting to stop drilling off their coast. When the oil industry comes to town, it is impossible to make them leave. For our economies, for our communities, for our tourism and fishing industries, for our environment, and most importantly, for our children and future generations, it's simply not worth the risk.

""Moving through 2018 we're determined to keep delivering our operational targets and maintaining capital discipline while growing cash flow and returns,"" he added. The world's leading oil companies are set to generate greater amounts of cash in 2018, following a sustained period of cutbacks in recent years. Nonetheless, while most executives have tended to urge caution amid uncertainty over oil prices in the near and long-term, BP CEO Bob Dudley had described the company's fourth-quarter figures as their ""best earnings in recent history."" ""I think what you're seeing coming through those earning numbers is an improved ramp-up of the projects … underlying production growth in the upstream of around 14 percent and a resilient downstream,"" Brian Gilvary, chief financial officer at BP, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday. Upstream is classed as the exploration and production aspects of the oil industry. ""So overall a strong set of results this quarter,"" he added. The latest figures come at a time when the environment for oil companies is dramatically improving, amid signs the energy market is rebalancing and crude futures have rallied to multi-year highs. The main driver for a recent uptick in oil prices has been a supply cut from major oil producing group OPEC and its allied partners, who started to withhold output in January last year. The production cuts are scheduled to continue throughout 2018. The move has helped to stabilize crude futures and support oil companies in recent quarters. Brent crude traded at $74.81 a barrel on Tuesday morning, up 0.1 percent, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) was at $68.71 a barrel, 0.2 percent higher. ""We expect improving earnings and cash generation to show through early 2018 as BP captures higher commodity prices and widening crude spreads,"" Biraj Borkhataria, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a research note Tuesday. ""We expect BP's cash flow generation to improve this year, both on an absolute basis and relative to peers. This should help improve confidence around BP's dividend,"" Borkhataria added. On Thursday, Shell reported a 42 percent rise in profits during the first three months of the year, underpinned by a recent uptick in oil and gas prices. The Anglo-Dutch firm said steady progress in its divestment program had helped the company beat analyst expectations, though some external observers were concerned about its cash flow generation.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/01/bp-earnings-q1-2018.html,Earnings,CNBC
529,2018-05-01,2018,5.0,1,,'Complete urban myth': BP CFO refutes reports CEO Bob Dudley was poisoned in Russian plot,"BP's finance chief does not believe there is any evidence to support the story that the oil giant's chief executive was once poisoned in a Russian plot. Bob Dudley, the American boss of the British oil major, was thought to have been forced to leave Moscow in 2008 after blood test results showed he was slowly being poisoned, British newspaper The Sunday Telegraph reported, citing a former employee of BP. ""I think that firmly sits in the category of urban myth,"" Brian Gilvary told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday. ""I served on the TNK board for two terms, one with Bob and one when Bob left, but the story seems to do the rounds every three, four or five years."" ""I think it is a complete urban myth and there is absolutely no substance to that story that we're aware of within the company,"" he added. Rumors of the plot — which was said to have been orchestrated by Russian security services — first circulated in 2014. At the time of the alleged incident, Dudley was running a profitable joint venture called TNK-BP. The Sunday Telegraph reported Russian authorities were looking for ways to oust Dudley, and about 150 other Western executives, from the country. It was then suggested that Russian intelligence agency FSB decided to administer a harmful toxin into Dudley's bloodstream. When asked how he would describe BP's relationship with Russian partners in light of recent reports, Gilvary replied: ""TNK-BP was a great (and) very successful joint venture but it could be noisy at times with some of our partners. I think the difference today is actually the relationship is with oil and gas people. It's Rosneft — it's an oil and gas company and we have a very good working relationship on the ground. ""But the relationship is good… and it is very different to what we had with TNK-BP."" Around five years after Dudley left Russia, TNK-BP was sold to Rosneft. In return, BP was paid a £12 billion ($16.3 billion) lump sum and given a 12.5 percent stake in the state-owned company.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/01/complete-urban-myth-bp-cfo-refutes-reports-ceo-bob-dudley-was-poisoned-in-russian-plot.html,Oil,CNBC
530,2018-05-01,2018,5.0,1,,BP CFO: Oil prices are looking 'frothy' and could lead to a correction,"Oil prices look to have climbed to unsustainable levels and could soon start to fall away from multi-year highs, BP's chief financial officer (CFO) told CNBC Tuesday. Crude futures stood within $1 of highs not seen in more than three years on Tuesday morning, amid a broad price recovery which has helped the resurgence of some of the world's largest oil and gas groups in recent quarters. ""Sometimes people forget that actually, it was not that long ago we were down at $28 a barrel … I think oil prices today feel a bit frothy,"" Brian Gilvary, CFO at BP, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" Tuesday. He added the recent uptick in crude futures had most likely been driven by elevated global demand and a stronger-than-expected alliance to OPEC-led production cuts. The price of oil collapsed from highs of almost $120 a barrel in June 2014 due to weak demand, a strong dollar and booming U.S. shale production. OPEC's reluctance to cut output was also seen as a key reason behind the fall. But, the oil cartel soon moved to implement output cuts — along with other oil-producing nations — in late 2016. Alongside Russia and other allied producers, OPEC has spearheaded an ongoing international effort to try to clear a global supply overhang and prop up prices. The agreement, which came into effect in January 2017, has already been extended through until the end of this year — with producers scheduled to meet in June to review policy. The output controls have widely been viewed as a success, with several major global producers honing in on achieving their original aim of reducing industrialized oil nations' back to their five-year average. Nonetheless, analysts have warned the energy market is extremely sensitive to any geopolitical developments, especially regarding the outcome of the Iran nuclear deal and sanctions. In less than two weeks, President Donald Trump must decide whether to continue suspending sanctions against Iran under the current nuclear accord, or restore penalties on one of the world's biggest oil producers. ""Geopolitics is now playing into where the price is and so I think you could see an oil price correction quite comfortably,"" BP's Gilvary said.

536,2018-07-27,2018,7.0,27,,BP buys BHP shale assets to beef up US business,"BP Plc has agreed to buy U.S. shale oil and gas assets from global miner BHP Billiton for $10.5 billion, expanding the British oil major's footprint in oil-rich onshore basins in its biggest deal in nearly 20 years. The acquisition marks a big turning point for BP since the Deepwater Horizon rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, for which the company is still paying off more than $65 billion in penalties and clean-up costs. ""This is a transformational acquisition for our Lower 48 business, a major step in delivering our upstream strategy and a world-class addition to BP's distinctive portfolio,"" BP chief Executive Bob Dudley said in a statement. In a further sign of the upturn in its fortunes, BP said it would increase its quarterly dividend for the first time in nearly four years and announced a $6 billion share buyback, to be partly funded by selling some upstream assets. The sale ends a disastrous seven-year investment by BHP in the shale business, which investors led by U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management have been pressing the company to jettison for the past 18 months. BHP put the business up for sale last August. Investors and analysts said the sale price was better than expected and were pleased that BHP planned to return the proceeds to shareholders. ""It was the wrong environment to have bought the assets when they did but this is the right market to have sold them in,"" said Craig Evans, co-portfolio manager of the Tribeca Global Natural Resources Fund. Analysts said they had assumed BHP would get between $8 billion and $10 billion in cash for the assets. BHP first acquired shale assets in 2011 for more than $20 billion with the takeover of Petrohawk Energy and shale gas interests from Chesapeake Energy Corp, but suffered as gas prices collapsed, forcing it to book massive writedowns. The world's biggest miner said it would record a further one-off shale charge of about $2.8 billion post-tax in its 2018 financial year results. The deal, BP's biggest since it bought oil company Atlantic Richfield Co in 1999, will increase its U.S. onshore oil and gas resources by 57 percent. BP will acquire BHP's unit which holds the Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Permian assets for $10.5 billion, giving it ""some of the best acreage in some of the best basins in the onshore U.S.,"" the company said. It beat rivals including Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron Corp for the assets, which have combined production of 190,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d)and 4.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent resources. BP said the transaction would boost its earnings and cash flow per share and it would still be able to maintain its gearing within a 20-30 percent range. The company also said it would increase its quarterly dividend by 2.5 percent to 10.25 cents a share, the first rise in 15 quarters. Meanwhile, a unit of Merit Energy Company will buy BHP Billiton Petroleum (Arkansas) Inc and the Fayetteville assets, for $0.3 billion. Tribeca's Evans welcomed the clean exit for cash, rather than asset swaps which BHP had flagged as a possibility. ""It leaves the company good scope to focus on their far better offshore oil business,"" he said. BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie said the company had delivered on its promise to get value for its shale assets, while the sale was consistent with a long-term plan to simplify and strengthen its portfolio. BHP shares rose 2.3 percent after the announcement, outperforming the broader market and rival Rio Tinto. BP said it would pay the $10.5 billion in installments over six months from the date of completion, with $5.25 billion of the consideration to be raised through the sale of new shares.

Underlying replacement cost (RC) profit, a proxy for net income, for the second quarter was $2.8 billion, quadruple the figure for the same period in 2017 and exceeding forecasts of $2.7 billion, according to a company-provided survey of analysts. The dividend was increased by 2.5 percent to 10.25 cents a share, the first time a hike has happened since the third quarter of 2014. BP chief executive Bob Dudley spoke exclusively to CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe "" Tuesday to discuss the company's forward momentum. ""We changed our strategic direction six quarters ago, this is the sixth quarter in a row we've been at or above expectations. The company's got momentum, it feels good,"" Dudley said, referencing several new projects driving the company's progress. BP brought on seven major projects in 2017, as well as three that have been brought online this year in Russia, Egypt and Azerbaijan and another three to go before the year's end. ""That gave us the confidence to raise the dividend this year for the first time in 15 quarters, as well as some great assets in North America,"" Dudley said. Production for the quarter was 3.6 million barrels a day (bpd) and upstream production, excluding Rosneft, was up 1.4 percent on the previous year. The company credited rising output from major projects as driving much of the rise. The earnings beat comes against the backdrop of higher crude prices as rising geopolitical risks in the Middle East, the crisis in Venezuela and a heavy crude outage in Canada help support oil markets. Oil rose above $70 a barrel again on Monday. Brent crude was trading above $75 per barrel on Tuesday. But Dudley said that the company is planning for a lower oil price despite the recent rise. ""You look at the oil price — we're planning BP on $50 to 65 a barrel,"" the BP CEO said. ""That's how we're going to plan the company, we're not going to get ahead of ourselves, we're going to keep the capital discipline ... We'll probably be at the low end of that this year, yet you do see pricing and revenues coming through stronger because of the markets."" The results come after BP announced the acquisition of BHP Billiton's shale assets for $10.5 billion, which it says will beef up its U.S. business and increase earnings and cash per share.

Lund, who also led BG Group during its acquisition by rival Royal Dutch Shell, will replace Carl-Henric Svanberg, chairman of BP for almost nine years, at the beginning of next year. The 55-year-old Lund steered Statoil through its transformation from a state oil company into a leading global player, and is likely to have to navigate BP through the succession of its veteran CEO Bob Dudley later this decade. “It is a good appointment,” said Rohan Murphy, analyst at asset manager Allianz Global Investors. “He has already had a great career and coming from Statoil and BG shows his upstream expertise which is still the main driver of earnings at BP so it is key to understand this well.” Lund will join BP at a time when the British oil and gas company is growing quickly, having recovered from the deadly Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 that brought the company to the brink of collapse. The Norwegian earned his reputation as a leader when he oversaw Statoil’s shift from a domestic-focused state oil firm into an international major over the 10 years to 2014. He was also CEO of BG Group from 2015 to 2016. Just two months into the job, he agreed to a takeover by Shell which corporate filings showed would trigger payouts that could net him more than 32 million pounds ($48 million). Lund will join BP’s board as chairman designate and a non-executive director on Sept. 1 and will become chairman on Jan 1, the company said. It did not give salary details. “Our industry is changing faster than ever as the world focuses on meeting the dual challenge of more energy with fewer emissions ... Helge has a track record of leadership in addressing these issues,” Svanberg said in a statement. Svanberg, from Sweden, became chairman on Jan. 1, 2010, four months before the worst offshore oil disaster in U.S. history that left 11 workers dead. He played a key role in the aftermath of the disaster that cost the company over $65 billion. Lund, who is also chairman of Denmark’s Novo Nordisk AS, will stand down as a director at oilfield service company Schlumberger with immediate effect. He has been a Schlumberger director since June 2016. He started his career as a consultant with McKinsey & Company and a parliamentary adviser for Norway’s Conservative party. Lund was also on the board of directors of Nokia from 2011 to 2014.

BP described Chargemaster as operating the largest EV charging network in the U.K. Founded in 2008, the company runs a public network of more than 6,500 EV charging points and designs, builds, sells and maintains EV charging units, BP said. “Bringing together the U.K.’s leading fuel retailer and its largest charging company, BP Chargemaster will deliver a truly differentiated offer for the country’s growing number of electric vehicle owners,” BP’s Tufan Erginbilgic said in a statement. The market for EVs is expanding, with BP estimating that there will be 12 million on U.K. roads by 2040, up from roughly 135,000 in 2017. Customers will require “convenient access” to both fast and ultra-fast charging systems in order to accelerate the adoption of EVs, BP said. A key goal of BP Chargemaster will be the rollout of an ultra-fast charging infrastructure. This is set to include “rapid chargers” that are able to provide vehicles with 100 miles of range in only 10 minutes. BP added that U.K. drivers could expect to see chargers on gas station forecourts during the next 12 months. Chargemaster operates POLAR, the U.K.’s biggest public charging network, which has more than 40,000 customers, BP said. The business also supplies home charging points throughout Britain. “The acquisition of Chargemaster by BP marks a true milestone in the move towards low carbon motoring in the U.K.,” David Martell, Chargemaster’s chief executive, said. Martell added that the strength and scale of BP would help the business maintain its “market-leading position and grow the national POLAR charging network to support the large range of exciting new electric vehicles that are coming to market in the next couple of years.” Upon completion of the acquisition, employees of Chargemaster will remain employed by BP Chargemaster or its subsidiaries.

BP, one of the largest oil producers in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, said GE’s Plant Operations Advisor (POA) software should help it save more than $200 million annually from its deployment at up to 33 platforms globally. The POA gathers data from various pieces of equipment on offshore platforms and processes it through GE’s proprietary Predix software to inform BP engineers when a part may be near breaking down. Terms of the BP-GE deal were not disclosed. The two companies started a partnership earlier this year with the goal of developing oilfield efficiency products. “This makes it much easier for people to act on the information and the data we already collect,” said Ahmed Hashmi, head of upstream technology at BP. BP estimates that using the GE software program will boost its efficiency by 2 percent to 4 percent. For GE’s part, executives are hoping the BP partnership will portend future opportunities across the oil industry, especially ahead of the company’s merger of its oil and gas division with Baker Hughes BHI.N. “Baker Hughes provides more opportunity to take Big Data into the oilfields,” said Lorenzo Simonelli, chief executive of GE Oil & Gas. “We’re seeing good examples of how big data is changing the outcomes of the oil and gas industry.” Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Marguerita Choy",http://www.reuters.com/article/general-electric-bp-idUSL1N1DF21I,Business News,Reuters
542,2018-04-24 00:00:00,2018,4.0,24,,REFILE-Cambridge donor BP urges university to keep fossil fuel investments,"(Corrects spelling of name in paragraphs 10, 11) LONDON, April 24 (Reuters) - BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley on Tuesday urged Cambridge University not to yield to pressure from hundreds of students and academics to cut its investments in fossil fuels and pointed to BP’s donations to the university. “We donate and do a lot of research at Cambridge so I hope they come to their senses,” Dudley told the AIPN International Petroleum Summit. BP did not immediately disclose how much it has been donating to the university. In 2015/16 it gave grants worth around 1.4 million pounds, according to Cambridge, and in 2000 a 22 million pound donation from BP helped to create the BP Institute for Multiphase Flow, which focuses on research in surfaces and particles and fluid dynamics. Cambridge’s University Council is expected to decide within weeks whether it will change its investments after years of campaigning by students and academics. Last week, around 350 Cambridge academics signed a letter to the university and its colleges, which enjoy a certain degree of independence from the university’s central administration, to excise fossil fuel investments from the roughly 6.3 billion pounds ($8.81 billion) at their disposal. “We ... call on the university’s investment office to immediately freeze any new investments in fossil fuel companies, and to divest from direct ownership and any commingled funds that include fossil fuel public equities and corporate bonds within five years,” an open letter said. Signatories include chemist David King, who was Britain’s Special Representative for Climate Change until last year following his seven-year stint as the government’s Chief Scientific Advisor. Cambridge had no immediate response to Dudley’s comments. Activists in the Cambridge Zero Carbon Society said they received a letter on Monday from vice-Chancellor Stephen Toope which stated the university had a leadership role in understanding and tackling climate change. “The objective ... is to promote and execute urgent and tangible action to deliver a carbon neutral future. The University is already taking steps that must be further expanded in the areas of its investments, research, education, estate and policy decisions,” Toope’s letter said. When asked about Dudley’s comment, a spokesman for the activist group said “if the University is unable to divest its endowment in line with the democratic wishes of students and staff due to these threats, then there is no longer academic independence at Cambridge.” The world’s top oil and gas companies are facing rising pressure from investors to shift to cleaner energy and renewables in order to meet international targets to sharply reduce carbon emissions by the end of the century. Dudley said that BP was going to invest around $500 million per year in renewables in the coming years, but that the world will need oil and gas “for many years to come.” $1 = 0.7154 pounds

543,2016-02-24 00:00:00,2016,2.0,24,Barbara Lewis,"BP sees end in sight for oil glut, but impact will linger","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Strong demand should start to cut into an oil glut around the end of this year, even as new Iranian supplies enter the market and doubts persist over whether major oil producers will reduce output, BP’s (BP.L) chief economist said on Wednesday. But a stock overhang could still linger for at least a year. Oil LCOc1 prices dropped to their lowest since 2003 last month under the pressure of a supply surplus of around 1 million barrels per day (bpd). Saudi Oil Minister Ali Al-Naimi has ruled out imminent OPEC production cuts, although he said on Tuesday he was confident more nations would join a pact to freeze output. Fellow OPEC member, Iran, meanwhile, is eager to increase output after sanctions were lifted. BP’s Spencer Dale said he could not predict what OPEC and other major producers would do and said promised freezes had come from nations unlikely to increase output anyway. “What is clear, is the oil market is behaving like any market. Prices are falling quite sharply and, as a response, demand is growing quite fast. Last year, global oil demand grew by twice its 10-year average,” he said. Demand growth, although probably not as strong as last year, would continue, he said, while new supplies, especially from U.S. tight oil - around half a million bpd below its peak - contract. “Even allowing for Iranian supply, I see flat to falling global supplies this year and so I think you’ll see a big swing in the market. By the end of this year, the market moves closer into balance,” he said. “There will still be a highly significant stock overhang,” he added, which could take a year or more to disappear. BP also for the long term to 2035 predicts rising oil demand as the number of vehicles outside the developed world triples. It has previously underestimated renewable sources, such as wind and solar, while over-estimating nuclear and biofuels. Overall, it expects non-fossil fuel to grow by around 6.5 percent. That is more than any other energy source, although its share stays below 10 percent of the mix, as the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), which BP says it supports, remains too weak to drive a faster transition to lower carbon sources. BP foresees a 20 percent rise in planet-warming emissions by 2035, or by 10 percent in its lower carbon scenario, which assumes a carbon price of $100 per tonne. That compares with below five euros per tonne CFI2Zc1 at present on the over-supplied ETS. Editing by Susan Thomas",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-bp-idUSKCN0VX1GK,Business News,Reuters

Oil majors including BP and Total are investing in the waters of Senegal and Mauritania in the hope of repeating the recent exploration success of smaller players. “Yakaar-1...further confirms our belief that offshore Senegal and Mauritania is a world-class hydrocarbon basin,” Bernard Looney, BP Upstream chief executive officer, said. New York-listed Kosmos in 2015 discovered a gas pool in the Tortue 1 exploration well, part of the Greater Tortue Complex spanning Senegal and Mauritania, which contained more than 15 trillion cubic feet of gas. Since then, BP has formulated plans to acquire a 30 percent interest in the two offshore blocks called Saint-Louis Profond that includes the Senegalese sector of the Tortue field and Cayar Profond. BP has also agreed to buy a stake of close to 60 percent in Kosmos’ Mauritania exploration blocks. Gas from the Tortue field is due to begin flowing in 2021 and is set to be exported from a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility. The two firms said on Thursday that the Yakaar-1 find contained sufficient reserves to warrant another LNG project. Kosmos spokesman Thomas Golembeski, declined to give further details on the nature or timing of the project, adding that further appraisal work was planned.

The blue chip FTSE 100 index was up 0.4 percent at 7,235.30 points by 0855 GMT, in line with a broadly positive European market. Oil major BP was among standout performers, its shares up 1.8 percent after its profit nearly tripled in the first quarter of 2017. Higher oil prices and production helped BP report a first-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, the company’s definition of net income, of $1.51 billion, beating analysts’ average forecast of $1.26 billion. “The broader theme is that BP is looking in better shape because of the higher oil price, and while oil prices hold their ground, BP, alongside with all of the other oil companies are going to benefit,” Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said. “Part of the attraction with BP is that they started the cost cutting before some of the big oil majors because of Deepwater (Horizon), but now as the oil price does continue to hold up, maybe you don’t necessarily want as much cost cutting anymore, you want to start expanding,” Lawler added, referring to BP’s deadly Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010. Precious metals miners were on the backfoot, however, with both Fresnillo and Randgold Resources dropping 2.6 percent after the price of gold, considered a ‘safe haven’ asset, held near three-week lows as equities rallied and the dollar gained. [GOL] Banking stocks Barclays and Standard Chartered were also weaker, as were miners Glencore and Anglo American. Outside of the blue chips, online supermarket Ocado jumped 6.7 percent after a media report said that the company was exploring a delivery tie-up with Marks & Spencer. Earnings also drove shares in Aberdeen Asset Management, which rose 3.4 percent after it reported a 10.6 percent rise in first-half revenues, boosted by market gains and cost cuts. It also saw a slowdown in the pace of outflows from its funds, a boost as the company prepares to merge with blue chip peer Standard Life, whose shares rose 2.4 percent. Just Eat fell more than 4 percent, however, after reporting first quarter results, with UK order growth in particular disappointing. “A tough quarter for (Just Eat), hard comps and some operational issues evident. Given that, a solid outcome, investor sentiment may home in on the UK and +16.5% order growth, consistent with the FY17 guide,” David Reynolds, equity analyst at Jefferies, said in a note.

547,2018-10-10 00:00:00,2018,10.0,10,,"Expect 'extreme volatility' for oil prices due to the Iran sanctions, BP CEO says","Uncertainty surrounding Iran's oil industry ahead of forthcoming U.S. sanctions could prompt ""extreme volatility"" for oil prices, BP's chief executive told CNBC Wednesday. ""I think it's going to be 45 days of extreme volatility, it could spike up, it could also go the other way,"" he told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick in London. Dudley's comments come at a time when oil market players are closely watching what happens when U.S. sanctions on Iran's oil industry come into force on November 4. It's hard to be precise over how much of Iran's production will be affected by the sanctions. It largely depends on whether the country's oil-buying customers are afraid of secondary sanctions from the U.S. if they do business with Iran. BP's competitor Total announced in August that it was pulling out of a giant oil and gas project in the Islamic republic. But BP and Serica Energy were granted a new license Tuesday to run a North Sea gas field partly owned by Iran showing the U.S. is willing to make some exemptions to the reach of the sanctions. ""If waivers were granted to others, to big oil consuming countries, you could see it (the price) go down, there's a lot of uncertainty right now,"" Dudley said. Some analysts predict as much as 1.5 million barrels per day could be removed from the market, an event that could cause prices to rise further. On Wednesday, Brent crude futures were trading at $84.96 per barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate was trading at $74.92. Dudley didn't see demand falling as a result of high prices due to global GDP growth (seen at 3.7 percent in 2018 and 2019 by the International Monetary Fund) still being robust. ""It's still growing, demand, it might be a little bit off but we don't see that destruction yet,"" he said. ""You look at the GDP (gross domestic product) growth in the world and that's a very indicator on the demand growth for oil and it has been for decades and decades so … If you start to see half a percent come off GDP growth around the world, it might be a 200,000 barrel a day drop in demand, the way our economists view it, and it's not that much,"" he said. Earlier on Wednesday, Dudley told the Oil and Money conference in London that ""we are a fair way off good oil prices,"" Reuters reported, and that the company was planning on a cycle of oil prices at $60 to $65 a barrel. He echoed those comments to CNBC, stating, ""We've been through this period of really low prices and they're up again and we can't plan on these high prices right now,"" he said, adding that markets are a ""little off"" what could be considered a healthy price for oil. ""So we're going to continue to plan our company at a much lower price."" President Donald Trump has called on OPEC to increase production to mitigate any Iranian shortfall and impact on prices. Saudi Arabia, the de-facto leader of OPEC, says it has the spare capacity to fulfil any shortfall created by Iran, but Iran has disputed that. Dudley said OPEC ""is a better expert on the technical points"" but believed that Saudi Arabia did have enough oil. ""I think Saudi Arabia does have capacity they could bring to the market. But on the other side of it you have very unpredictable circumstances in Venezuela and of course, the Iran sanctions. But Dan Yergin (energy expert at IHS Markit) had a great quote saying that actually the markets appear to be in balance, but emotionally they're not stable right now.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/10/bp-ceo-says-oil-markets-will-see-extreme-volatility-iran-sanctions.html,Oil,CNBC
548,2018-10-30 00:00:00,2018,10.0,30,,BP earnings Q3 2018,"BP reported third-quarter profits more than doubled on Tuesday, underpinned by stronger oil prices. The British oil giant posted first-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, used as a proxy for net profit, of $3.8 billion for the three-month period ending Sept 30. Analysts at data firm Refinitiv had been expecting third-quarter net profit to come in at around £3.013 billion ($3.847 billion). In the third quarter of 2017, BP reported net profit of $1.865 billion. ""Overall a good set of results with everything working well,"" Brian Gilvary, CFO at BP, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday. Here are the key takeaways: Earlier this year, BP announced the acquisition of BHP's Billiton's shale assets for $10.5 billion. At the time, the oil firm claimed the purchase would allow it to beef up its U.S. business and increase earnings and cash per share. The original deal was agreed with BP offering 50 percent cash and 50 percent shares for BHP Billiton's shale assets. However, the company announced it would now complete the transaction at the end of the month from available cash without resorting to a rights issue as planned. Gilvary said this ""simplified the transaction an awful lot."" Oil and gas production for the first nine months of the year rose to 2.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day and was well placed to increase further, BP said, thanks in large part to its acquisition of BHP's U.S. shale business. ""Our focus on safe and reliable operations and delivering our strategy is driving strong earnings and growing cash flow,"" BP CEO Bob Dudley said in a statement. ""This progress all underpins our commitment to growing distributions for our shareholders."" Shares of BP rose more than 4 percent Tuesday morning. The earnings beat comes against a backdrop of higher crude prices, as energy market participants monitor looming U.S. sanctions on Iran, OPEC's third largest oil producer, and keep a close eye on heightened tensions between Washington and Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter. ""We believe it was another strong quarter for BP, with the company continuing to move in the right direction with solid production growth, aggressive cost cutting, and financial discipline, while improving operationally,"" Brian Youngberg, senior energy analyst at Edward Jones, said in a research note published Tuesday. ""While growth should be relatively robust in 2018 and into 2019, we still see its longer-term outlook as less attractive than its European peers, and we reiterate our 'Hold' rating with an appropriate valuation relative to 2019 cash flow,"" Youngberg said. Oil prices have soared nearly 17 percent so far this year, although worries over the global economy have since put crude on track for its biggest monthly fall since mid-2016. Nonetheless, despite a recent pullback in oil prices, the world's leading oil and gas companies are set to generate greater amounts of cash in 2018. It follows a sustained period of cutbacks in recent years. ""(Oil) prices may soften a little but I think they are going to probably stay over $70 a barrel in the short to medium-term,"" BP's Gilvary said Tuesday. However, when asked whether he shared energy market concerns about the introduction of U.S. sanctions against Iran, Gilvary said crude futures could fluctuate wildly as these measures come into force. ""You're going to see oil prices move in the range of plus or minus $5, maybe plus or minus $10 a barrel off the back of any geopolitical uncertainties that we see going forward."" ""And then of course you have also got the supply and demand shocks that may come off the back of sanctions,"" he added.

BP will own a 49% stake in its new Indian joint venture, with the rest held by Reliance, operator of the world’s biggest refining complex.

Under the proposed $400 million agreement, British company BP (BP.L) and Italy’s Eni ENI.NI would run the scheme to build two seabed oil pipelines for Iraq’s southern exports through the Gulf, the sources told Reuters, declining to be named as the discussions have not been made public. The pipeline work was meant to be part of a larger, $53 billion project that Exxon (XOM.N) looked poised to move ahead with earlier this year, but an agreement with Baghdad was held back by contractual wrangling and security concerns, the officials said. The 30-year mega-project is the focus of Exxon’s plans to expand in Iraq, OPEC’s second-largest producer, and a chipping away of schemes from the deal could drag on the company’s ambitions. The BP and Eni talks with Baghdad follow an announcement from Iraqi officials in June that South Korea’s Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co Ltd (000720.KS) had been selected to build a $2.4 billion seawater injection facility - another part of the deal originally on the table with Exxon. ExxonMobil and Eni declined to comment, while BP had no immediate comment. In May, Iraq’s proposed bumper deal with Exxon appeared imminent. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discussed it with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi twice in three days, including during a surprise visit to Baghdad. Abdul Mahdi, meanwhile, said Iraq was close to signing the agreement with the American company and its venture partner PetroChina. But negotiations subsequently became protracted over contract conditions and escalating tensions between Iraq’s bigger neighbor Iran and the United States, Baghdad’s two main allies. Talks to reach at least an initial agreement were held up by two separate evacuations of Exxon’s foreign staff from Iraq, the first after Washington warned of Iranian threats to U.S. interests there, and the second prompted by a rocket attack that appeared to target the company. The five senior Iraqi oil officials said the delays had forced Iraq to consider other companies to help construct infrastructure for its offshore export terminals.     “We can’t wait for Exxon forever. We have serious problems with our sea pipelines and urgently need to find partners to help build new ones. Further delays could harm our sea export infrastructure,” said one of the officials, who oversees export infrastructure in the south of the country.  The project that Iraq is discussing with BP and Eni involves the replacement of two old seabed pipelines, including an idled one which transports crude to the Khor al-Amaya terminal. Loading operations have been halted at Khor al-Amaya since 2017 when the pipeline suffered ruptures and leakages and had to be shut, oil officials said. The other pipeline is operating at partial capacity to ship crude oil to the Basra offshore terminal. Under the proposed deal, BP would finance the project and Eni would handle the procurement, engineering and construction tendering aspects, the sources said. The negotiations are in their final stages after the parties worked out a mechanism to allow the British company to recover its financing payments. “In principle we agreed BP could recover its payments by taking oil shipments instead of cash, just like the mechanism we’re following to pay the company to develop Rumaila oilfields,” said one of the Iraqi officials. Eni will be paid in cash for its work, the officials said. The seawater injection project, which Hyundai has been selected for, was also originally part of Exxon’s planned deal to develop Iraq’s southern energy installations. Iraq has no major water injection plant and needs one for its wells or would risk losing pressure and face severe production decline, especially at its mature oilfields. As freshwater is a scarce resource in Iraq, using treated seawater is one of the best alternatives. Three of the oil officials said Exxon had costed the project at higher than Hyundai’s $2.4 billion. They said other parts of the proposed Exxon project could go to other companies if they offered lower costs, including a project to build additional crude storage. The Hyundai deal, announced by the state-run Basra Oil Co, still requires the final approval of the oil ministry. One of the officials said the agreement would be finalised before the end of year.

559,2018-11-12,2018,11.0,12,,"Trump keeps people guessing 'on many fronts' and it's impacting oil markets, BP's Bob Dudley says","President Donald Trump is one factor among many impacting oil markets right now, according to Bob Dudley, the chief executive of oil giant BP. ""He's (Trump is) keeping people guessing on many, many fronts and it also impacts the oil markets,"" Dudley told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe,"" but he added that the U.S. president was not the only factor affecting prices. ""It's more than that (the Trump administration). There's uncertainty in the supply from Venezuela, there's still disruptions in Libya, for example, there's a lot of uncertainty out there,"" Dudley said. Dudley's comments at the ADIPEC energy conference in Abu Dhabi come at a pivotal moment for oil markets with Saudi Arabia performing an about-turn this weekend by announcing a 500,000 barrel per day production cut in December. The surprise move comes after it had ramped up production this summer along with other major producers Russia and the U.S. due to concerns over a decline in supply once sanctions on Iran came into effect in November. The measure, taken by the defacto leader of OPEC, is seen as a way to halt a 20 percent slump in prices seen since early October on the back of the surge in production. Saudi Arabia's oil minister said Sunday that markets were well supplied and that price rises over the summer due to a feared Iranian shortfall had been an overreaction. Meanwhile, Dudley said OPEC's ministerial committee was not getting anything ""wrong"" in changing course, it was just recognizing that circumstances surrounding Iranian sanctions had changed, with the U.S. granting exemptions to eight countries that purchase Iranian oil. This had meant the impact of sanctions was not as bad as it could have been and so upping production was not as necessary. ""They (Saudi Arabia) were worried about (the) under supplying of the market and triple-digit oil prices. Now they're saying, actually, it (upping production) might be a little bit too much right now because of the exemptions,"" Dudley added. Dudley said Trump's decision to grant waivers to the sanctions was not unsurprising, saying ""I don't think he wanted to see $100 (a barrel) oil.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/12/trump-keeps-people-guessing-on-many-fronts-bp-bob-dudley-says.html,,CNBC
560,2018-11-26,2018,11.0,26,,"BP's Middle East chief isn't worried about low oil prices, says $50 a barrel is 'within range'","Oil producers across North America may be looking at dialing back their investment plans amid plummeting oil prices in recent weeks, but BP's Middle East chief is unfazed. The British oil giant has planned its investments with a wide price range in mind, accounting for drops like November's, BP Middle East President Michael Townshend told CNBC on Sunday. ""You don't plan on today's oil prices — you plan on a range,"" Townshend said during a conference in Dubai organized by the Iraqi British Business Council. ""We see a sensible range would be in that $50 to $70 range [?]. And that's what we plan on."" Crude prices have been on a rollercoaster ride, falling to a year-low on Friday, just weeks after hitting a nearly four-year high in October ahead of U.S. sanctions on Iran, OPEC's third-largest oil producer. Dubbed oil's ""Black Friday,"" global benchmark Brent crude dropped 6.1 percent to $58.80, down 22 percent for the month on fears that the world is oversupplied. The conference, centered on Iraq's reconstruction one year after the defeat of the Islamic State militant group, highlighted the need for investment and improved efficiency in Iraq's power sector. Asked if the lower oil prices would prove problematic for BP's Iraq operations, Townshend replied that the company was prepared for turns in the market. ""Our investment decisions are all based on a range of pricing, they're in that $50 to $70 range — whatever today happens to be, we have no control over whatever tomorrow happens to be,"" he said. ""Our job is to make sure we're as efficient as possible so we can work through whatever the oil price is. We can't predict the oil price."" But if history is any guide, a drop in oil prices means a drop in Iraq's capital expenditure, according to Frank Gunter, professor of economics at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Iraq's government will likely have a much harder time funding its own infrastructure development projects, he said. [?] When oil prices collapsed in 2014, capital expenditure dropped by 50 percent — meaning important investment projects were abandoned and had to be completely restarted years after. Speaking at the conference, Gunter pointed out the day's Brent crude price, at just below $60 a barrel. ""At $60 a barrel, the Iraqi government can afford to pay its current expenditures — the pensions, the salaries, the social safety net — but there is nothing left over for infrastructure investment,"" he warned. ""Sure, you can borrow,"" he added, but noted that borrowing has its limits, especially considering the substantial debt Iraq has racked up in recent years. ""A lot of infrastructure is needed — electricity and water come immediately to mind. Yet it does not appear that the money will be there."" Iraq's parliament this month rejected newly-appointed Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi's budget plan, which amounted to nearly $107 billion, with an estimated deficit of $19 billion. Iraq's oil revenues can cover 88 percent of the draft budget, but the parliament's rejection of it stems from the fact that it overlooks several important aspects of reconstruction and infrastructure needs, local lawmakers say. Particularly opposed to the proposed plan are representatives from Basra, the oil-rich southern city that's been wracked by violent protests since July over a collapse in basic services such as drinkable water and electricity. Mahdi, who formerly served as both oil minister and finance minister, has portrayed himself as a pragmatic economist with the will to take on Iraq's rampant corruption and diversify its revenue sources. Currently, more than 90 percent of the Iraqi government's revenue comes from oil. After several months of legislative wrangling over government formation, following an election that saw the lowest voter turnout since Saddam Hussein's ouster in 2003, Mahdi has a formidable task ahead of him. Whether he will be able to sidestep the powerful political interests that have benefited from graft and party patronage for years, which contribute to Iraq's reputation for stifling corruption, will be crucial for boosting that much-needed investment.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/26/bps-middle-east-chief-isnt-worried-about-low-oil-prices-says-50-a-barrel-is-within-range.html,Oil and Gas,CNBC
561,2018-12-19,2018,12.0,19,,BP launches $3 billion sale of US onshore assets to fund BHP deal: Sources,"Britain's BP has launched the sale of U.S. oil and gas onshore assets that could raise more than $3 billion to help pay for other fields in the United States it bought in October from BHP, industry and banking sources said. The sale proceeds will partly fund the $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP's onshore assets that are mostly around oil-producing fields in Texas and Louisiana. BP had said it would sell $5 billion to $6 billion to finance the deal. The London-listed firm wants to focus on production from its holdings in the Permian and Eagle Ford basins to match rivals Exxon Mobil and Chevron whose production there is set to rise sharply in coming years. BP's onshore business, which it has rebranded as BPX, sent out information packages last week on the assets it was selling and its representatives held a meeting in New York with the management teams of potential buyers, the sources said. This follows a series of informal talks the company held with private equity firms since the end of November aimed at gauging interest in the assets, two of the sources said. Interested parties include U.S. buyout funds Carlyle and Warburg Pincus, one of the sources said. BP, which sources said was not using a banking advisor on the sale, declined to comment. Carlyle and Warburg Pincus were not immediately available for comment. Investors have been stepping up pressure on publicly traded oil firms to curb spending and boost returns. ""That pressure is taking public companies out of the universe of buyers in the market, creating opportunities for private-equity companies,"" said Andrew Dittmar, an M&A analyst at researcher Drillinginfo. Private equity firms such as Ascent Resources, Aethon Energy Management and Encino Acquisition Partners have all made large purchases of oil-producing assets this year. BP is offering seven packages, all of them consisting of shale assets it held before the BHP deal, two of the sources said. Those include fields in the San Juan basin which straddles the Colorado-New Mexico border, the Cotton Valley field in East Texas, the Arkoma and Anadarko basins in Oklahoma, and the Wamsutter basin in Wyoming. There are a small number of non-operated stakes being offloaded, the sources said. The most attractive pieces are thought to be the San Juan assets, which include around 9,000 operated and non-operated wells and were the backbone of BP's U.S. onshore operations prior to the BHP deal, along with the Wamsutter basin. The sales document says the entire portfolio generates around $700 million in operating cashflow a year. Most of the assets are gas-rich, which could deter some investors at a time when the abundance of gas production across the United States has pushed down prices for the fuel. The Permian, encompassing parts of Texas and New Mexico, is at the heart of the U.S. shale boom and has some of the lowest production costs in North America, which is valuable when U.S. WTI crude prices CLc1 have slumped almost 40 percent since reaching a peak in October. U.S. shale production is forecast to hit 8.2 million bpd in January, according to the U.S. Energy Department, as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, drives U.S. output to a record 11.7 million barrels per day (bpd), making it the world's biggest crude producer.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/19/bp-launches-3-billion-sale-of-us-onshore-assets-to-fund-bhp-deal-sources.html,Oil and Gas,CNBC

The British energy company has discovered 1 billion barrels of crude at an existing oilfield in the Gulf of Mexico. BP also announced two new offshore oil discoveries and a major new investment in a nearby field. BP is the Gulf of Mexico's biggest producer, and it's making strides to hold that title. BP now expects its fossil fuel output from the region to reach 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by the middle of the next decade. Today, it produces about 300,000 boepd, up from less than 200,000 boepd about five years ago. On Tuesday, the company said it will spend $1.3 billion to develop a third phase of its Atlantis field off the coast of New Orleans. Scheduled to start production in 2020, the eight new wells will add 38,000 bpd to BP's production at Atlantis. The decision comes after BP found another 400 million barrels of oil at the field. BP made the massive 1 billion-barrel discovery at its Thunder Horse field off the tip of Louisiana. Executives are crediting their investment in advanced seismic technology and data processing for speeding up the company's ability to confirm the discoveries at Atlantis and Thunder Horse. BP says it once would have taken a year to analyze the Thunder Horse data, but it now takes just weeks. ""We are building on our world-class position, upgrading the resources at our fields through technology, productivity and exploration success,"" Bernard Looney, BP's chief executive for production and exploration, said in a statement. Just northeast of Thunder Horse, BP also announced new discoveries at fields near its Na Kika platform. BP says it plans to develop reservoirs at its Manuel prospect, where Shell holds a 50 percent stake. Producers also found oil at the Nearly Headless Nick prospect near Na Kika, where BP has a 20.25 percent working interest.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/08/bp-just-discovered-a-billion-barrels-of-oil-in-gulf-of-mexico.html,Energy,CNBC

564,2019-01-22,2019,1.0,22,,BP CEO Bob Dudley sees solid oil demand growth in 2019,"BP is expecting solid growth in oil demand this year despite growing concerns about a global economic slowdown, CEO Bob Dudley said Tuesday. The British energy giant forecasts the world's appetite for oil will grow by another 1.4 million barrels per day in 2019. That compares with demand growth of 1.3 million bpd last year, according to the International Energy Agency, a policy advisor to developed nations. The 2019 projection puts BP's view in line with the latest forecast from the Paris-based IEA, but ahead of OPEC, which sees demand growing at a more tepid 1.29 million bpd. ""We're not actually seeing this worrying thought that it's all going to start falling,"" Dudley told CNBC in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Asked whether that view holds despite the IMF cutting its outlook for global economic growth on Tuesday, Dudley said, ""We certainly don't see it yet in the numbers."" Oil prices slumped on Tuesday following the IMF revision and data showing China's economy expanded last year at the slowest pace since 1990. China is the world's second largest oil consumer. BP's in-house forecast sees the world economy expanding at 3 percent or more and U.S. gross domestic product growing ""a little bit under 3"" percent, Dudley said. Last month, the Federal Reserve cut its outlook for U.S. GDP growth for 2019 to 2.3 percent, down from a previous forecast of 2.5 percent. To be sure, forecasters including the IEA and OPEC expect global oil production to grow at a brisker pace than demand this year, led by rising output from the U.S. OPEC and 10 other oil producers, including Russia, are holding back 1.2 million bpd through June in order to drain an oversupply of crude oil. Dudley believes the oil market is tightening up, but says a big question is whether Washington continues granting waivers allowing several countries to continue buying Iranian crude, which is under U.S. sanctions. Dudley thinks oil prices are ""heading back into a reasonable balance"" following two ""big"" overcorrections, one that saw oil prices spike to nearly four-year highs in October and another that dragged prices to roughly 18-month lows in December. ""The world probably needs a fairway for oil prices, and somewhere between $50 and $65 seems to be a fairway for producers and consuming countries,"" Dudley said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/22/bp-ceo-bob-dudley-sees-solid-oil-demand-growth-in-2019.html,,CNBC

The British oil giant said its underlying replacement cost profit, used as a proxy for net profit, came in at $12.7 billion in 2018. A company-provided consensus forecast had expected full-year underlying replacement cost profit of $11.88 billion. ""This is a really good quarter and, actually, the end of a great year for us,"" Bob Dudley, chief executive of BP, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday. ""We've doubled our earnings from last year (and) we've doubled our returns from last year — that's what shareholders wanted to see,"" he added. Shares of BP rose toward the top of the European benchmark Tuesday morning, up more than 3 percent. BP's fourth-quarter profit jumped more than 65 percent when compared to the same period in 2017, following a sharp rise in oil and gas production and the acquisition of BHP's U.S. shale assets. Here are the key takeaways: Market participants saw large gains in energy shares over the first nine months of 2018 largely wiped out by a dramatic decline in crude futures in the fourth quarter. The value of a barrel of Brent crude soared to a four-year high of $86 a barrel in early October, before collapsing to around $50 within weeks.

569,2019-02-12,2019,2.0,12,,Bob Dudley: BP invested more money in Egypt than anywhere else in the last 2 years,"BP has invested more money in Egypt in the last two years than anywhere else, the oil giant's Chief Executive Bob Dudley told CNBC. ""Today (the scale of our operations) is very big,"" Dudley told CNBC Monday. ""We produce oil in the Gulf of Suez but really our focus in the last five years has been this big push for natural gas. All across from the Nile Delta, to the east, to the west of the Nile Delta, it's helping power the country and other companies are here as well."" ""In the last two years we've invested more money in Egypt, in both of those years, than in any other country in the world for BP, so it's a really important place for us,"" he told CNBC's Dan Murphy. Egypt might lack the oil producing clout of its OPEC neighbors to the west (Libya and Algeria) and east (Saudi Arabia) but it's pushing to become a Mediterranean energy hub, particularly in the natural gas sector. Cairo is expected to become a net gas exporter by the end of 2019 and the country has seen widespread interest in its natural gas potential — particularly after the success of Egypt's Zohr gas field, an offshore natural gas field in the Mediterranean Sea operated by Italian energy firm Eni. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Egypt's oil and gas sector reached $10 billion in the full fiscal year of 2017/18, the country's Petroleum Minister Tarek El-Molla told an Egyptian newspaper last August, and expects at least the same in 2018/2019. In December, El Molla said Egypt had signed over 12 exploration and production agreements with international oil companies (IOCs) during 2018. The petroleum minister told CNBC in January that Egypt's gas reserves could even be a catalyst for peace in the region. The Egyptian economy has been on an upward turn since the political tumult brought on by civil unrest during the Arab Spring of 2011 and the overthrow of then-President Hosni Mubarak. In 2016, Egypt was forced to request a three-year, $12 billion loan from the international Monetary Fund (IMF). As ever, the IMF aid came with strings attached, requiring the government to embark on a reform program that included cutting fuel subsidies, introducing VAT and floating its currency, the Egyptian pound. Egypt has been praised by the IMF for adhering to the program and the Fund sees its budget deficit and unemployment rate declining further this year; the IMF predicts GDP growth of 5.5 percent in 2019. BP's Dudley praised the ""strong set of reforms"" that had been implemented in Egypt in recent years. ""We've seen this big change over the last four or five years that has fundamentally changed things. You go back, five or seven, eight years ago and electricity wasn't even assured each day and now the infrastructure's here ... You're actually seeing Egypt move from a producing country into one that's going to begin to export energy as well and become a Mediterranean hub, it's very exciting."" BP announced the first gas production from the second stage of its large gas venture in Egypt, the West Nile Delta development, on Monday. Stage one of the project, which started producing in 2017, included gas production from the first two fields, Taurus and Libra. The second phase of the project — the Giza and Fayoum development — includes eight wells and is currently producing around 400 million cubic feet of gas per day (mmscfd) and is expected to ramp up to a maximum rate of approximately 700 mmscfd. The third stage of the West Nile Delta project will develop the Raven field and production is expected in late 2019, BP said in a statement Monday. When fully onstream in 2019, combined production from all three phases of the West Nile Delta project is expected to reach up to almost 1.4 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d), equivalent to about 20 percent of Egypt's current gas production. All the gas produced will be fed into the national gas grid. BP has an operating stake of 82.75 percent in the development, the company noted. Asked how much BP could spend in Egypt in 2019, Dudley said the amount would be significant. ""There will be a third phase we're spending on, we're exploring today with other companies ... (So we'll be spending) $1.8 billion give or take. That's a lot,"" he said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/12/bob-dudley-bp-invested-more-money-in-egypt-than-anywhere-else.html,Energy,CNBC
570,2017-08-01,2017,8.0,1,"Ron Bousso, Karolin Schaps",BP production growth boost shares despite profit drop,"LONDON (Reuters) - British energy company BP’s second-quarter profit dipped but beat forecasts after an exploration write-off in Angola, while a 10 percent rise in oil and gas production from a slew of new projects gave shares a strong boost. BP also increased cash flow from operations in a further sign that efforts by top oil companies to cut costs since the 2014 price slump are paying off as it expects oil prices to hold at around $50 a barrel into next year. “We continue to position BP for the new oil price environment, with a continued tight focus on costs, efficiency and discipline in capital spending,” Chief Executive Bob Dudley said in a statement. BP shares were up 3.4 percent at 0804 GMT, outperforming the broader sector index, which was up 1.2 percent. At the same time, BP saw its debt pile rise to nearly $40 billion as it invests in bringing projects online and continues to pay off its bill relating to the deadly 2010 Deepwater Horizon rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico. Gearing, the ratio between debt and BP’s market value, rose to 28.8 percent by the end of June from 24.7 percent a year earlier. Despite the sharp slowdown in the sector’s activity since prices halved three years ago, BP is set to launch seven oil and gas projects in 2017 — the largest number in a single year in its history. BP’s production was up 9.9 percent from a year earlier at 2.431 million barrels of oil equivalent per day helped by some of the new start-ups. They include the Quad 204 oilfield, one of the largest projects in the North Sea in recent years which BP launched in May after a $5.7 billion redevelopment. BP said its oil and gas production will be broadly flat in the third quarter as further project start-ups outweigh the impact of maintenance. The company hopes to add 800,000 barrels per day of new production by the end of the decade. Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary told Reuters BP’s 2017 capital spending was expected to be around $16 billion, in the middle of the forecast range. Banco Santander analyst Jason Kenney said he saw “optimism that BP could move forward with more robust delivery than currently expected in 2H17 and going into 2018”. BP’s quarterly underlying replacement cost profit, the company’s definition of net income, came in at $684 million, topping the $500 million forecast in a company-provided analyst consensus. That was down from $720 million a year earlier and $1.51 billion in the first quarter. The results were impacted by a $750 million charge for unsuccessful exploration campaigns in Angola. BP’s operating cash flow, excluding payments related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, rose in the second quarter of the year to $6.9 billion from $5.3 billion a year earlier. BP’s operating cash flow, including payments related to the spill, rose to $4.9 billion in the first quarter of the year from $3.9 billion a year earlier. Payments related to the Gulf of Mexico settlement are set to reach $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion in 2017 before falling to $2 billion in 2018. BP has so far paid a pre-tax total of $63.214 billion in clean up costs and penalties.

571,2019-02-14,2019,2.0,14,,BP forecast sees renewables and natural gas dominating energy,"In a not-too-distant future, renewable energy becomes the world's biggest source of power generation. A quarter of the distances that humans travel by vehicle will be in electric cars. U.S. dominance in the oil market begins to wane, and OPEC's influence is resurgent, as crude demand finally peaks. That is the vision laid out by British oil and gas giant BP on Thursday in its latest Annual Energy Outlook. The closely followed report lays out a vision through 2040 for Earth's energy future, provided government policy, technology and consumer preferences evolve in line with recent trends. BP forecasts that the world's energy demand will grow by a third through 2040, driven by rising consumption in China, India and other parts of Asia. About 75 percent of that increase will come from the need to power industry and buildings. At the same time, energy demand will continue to grow in the transportation sector, but that growth will slow sharply as vehicles become more efficient and more consumers opt for electric cars. But despite the increase in supply, BP thinks two-thirds of the world's population will still live in places with relatively low energy consumption per head. The takeaway: The world will need to generate more energy. Most of that new energy — as much as 85 percent — will come from burning natural gas and drawing on renewable power, according to BP's main scenario. By the end of the next two decades, BP thinks renewables will provide most of the world's electric power, as wind, solar and other renewable energy sources spread through the system at a faster pace than any fuel throughout the course of human history. Meanwhile, natural gas consumption will grows by 50 percent over the next 20 years, increasing in virtually every corner of the globe, the forecast said. The electric power sector and industry will drive the increase, though the fastest growth will be in the transportation sector, albeit from a low base. BP sees most of the new supplies coming from the U.S., Qatar and Iran, with China and Russia playing a smaller role. Also during the period, shipments of liquefied natural gas — a form of the fuel chilled to its liquid state and exported by ship — will continue to grow, ultimately accounting for 15 percent of gas trade by 2040. Throughout most of that time, the world will continue to consume more oil year after year, until demand ultimately peaks around 108 million barrels per day in the 2030s. This year, OPEC expects global oil demand to reach 100 million bpd. Despite the anticipated plateau, BP says the industry will have to keep investing in new oil production to meet growing consumption and account for declining output at legacy fields. The biggest source of demand will continue to be transportation, with consumption for planes and ships growing by 3 million barrels a day and the world's road fleet guzzling another 2 million barrels a day by 2040. Most of that demand is seen coming from emerging markets, where the middle class will expand, especially in Asia. For the first part of the next two decades, the U.S., Brazil, Russia and other non-OPEC members will meet most of the world's growing appetite. But towards the end of the period, BP sees output declining from U.S. shale fields — the engine of the American oil renaissance — and OPEC reasserting its dominance. The Middle East-dominated group's production will increase by 4 million barrels a day through 2040, with most of that growth happening after 2030, BP says. However, BP sees a scenario where low-cost producers like Saudi Arabia, spurred by the looming peak in demand, pump at full throttle, driving down prices and increasing demand for oil. The picture is more complicated for coal. On the whole, coal consumption would flatline, as China and developed countries quit the fossil fuel in favor of cleaner-burning and renewable energy sources. However, BP sees India and other Asian nations burning more coal to meet surging power demand as the nations become more prosperous.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/14/bp-forecast-sees-renewables-and-natural-gas-dominating-energy.html,Energy,CNBC
572,2019-02-14,2019,2.0,14,,"As renewables soar, BP sees China hitting brakes on energy growth","* BP publishes benchmark 2019 Energy Outlook * Renewables seen expanding at unprecedented rate by 2040 * Energy demand expected to soar by a third * India set for fastest growth * Oil demand to peak in mid-2030s LONDON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Global demand for renewable power will soar at an unprecedented pace over the coming decades, BP said in a benchmark report on Thursday, while China's energy growth is seen sharply decelerating as its economic expansion slows. Still, China is set to remain the largest energy consumer by a long stretch into 2040 although India should overtake it in terms of demand growth beginning in the next decade, the British oil and gas giant said in its 2019 Energy Outlook. China's energy demand rose by 5.9 percent over the past 20 years, but is set to grow by only 1 percent by 2040 as its economy shifts from energy-intensive industries to services and as Beijing introduces stricter rules on air pollution. BP revised down its forecast of China's energy demand by 7 percent from last year's report, ""reflecting the pace at which China is adjusting to a more sustainable pattern of economic growth"". Under BP's base-case Evolving Transition scenario, global energy demand will increase by around one third by 2040, driven by rapidly expanding middle classes in Asia. RENEWABLES EXPLOSION Renewables are expected to be the fastest-growing energy source with an annual gain of 7.1 percent, accounting for half the growth in global energy. Their share in primary energy is seen rising from 4 percent today to around 15 percent by 2040. Compared with the level in last year's report, BP raised by 9 percent its 2040 forecast of demand for renewable power such as solar and wind. Renewables and natural gas, the least-polluting fossil fuel, will account for 85 percent of the growth in energy demand. ""Renewables will penetrate the energy system quicker than any other fuel ever,"" BP Chief Economist Spencer Dale told reporters before the release of the report. Solar power will increase by a factor of 10 by 2040 and wind by a factor of five under BP's basic scenario. While the share of oil in world energy demand rose from 1 percent to 10 over 45 years in the early 20th century, renewables are set to reach the same share over 25 years, Dale said. EMISSIONS RISING In a world struggling to tackle climate change by curbing greenhouse gas emissions and to bring billions of people out of poverty, demand for electricity is set to account for around three quarters of the growth in energy. Global energy-related carbon emissions hit a historic high of 32.5 gigatons in 2017, after being flat for three years, due to increased energy demand and the slowing of energy efficiency improvements, the International Energy Agency said last year. The unprecedented growth in renewables is, however, not sufficient to meet U.N.-backed targets set under the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement to curb carbon emissions in order to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, he added. Under the Evolving Transition scenario, carbon emissions will grow by 10 percent by 2040, much faster than in the past. OIL DEMAND BP expects oil demand to plateau at around 108 million barrels per day (bpd) by the mid-2030s, amid growth in electric vehicles and higher engine efficiency. Transportation continues to be the main driver of growth in oil consumption, with its share remaining stable at around 55 percent by 2040. Demand for transport services will almost double by 2040, but gains of nearly 50 percent in engine efficiency for cars and trucks mean energy consumed by the sector should grow by only 20 percent. Oil used to produce plastics is the largest source of demand growth over the period, increasing by 7 million bpd to 22 million bpd. The growth in oil supply will initially come from rapidly expanding U.S. shale production, which BP expects will grow by 6 million bpd over the next 10 years, peaking at 10.5 million bpd in the late 2020s. As U.S. shale output declines, production from members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will take the lead. TRADE WARS BP warned that an escalation in trade disputes could significantly reduce energy demand due to slowing economic growth. A 6 percent reduction in global gross domestic product in the period to 2040 versus BP's base-case scenario would lead to a 4 percent decline in energy demand, it said. Lower demand and slowing energy trade flows would have the biggest impact on oil and gas exporting countries such as Russia and the United States, BP said.

573,2016-10-11,2016,10.0,11,"Sonali Paul, Karolin Schaps",BP scraps plan to drill off Australia's south coast,"MELBOURNE/LONDON (Reuters) - Oil major BP has scrapped plans to drill for oil and gas off the southern coast of Australia because it is too expensive in the face of low oil prices that have prompted heavy cost-cutting across the sector. The Great Australian Bight project has been condemned by environmental groups who say it would damage whale and sea lion breeding grounds, but BP’s withdrawal can only be viewed as a partial victory for campaigners because the company and a number of others still hold exploration permits for the area. BP said the project, in which it is partnered by Norway’s Statoil, would not be able to compete for capital investment with other opportunities in its global portfolio for the foreseeable future. “This decision isn’t a result of a change in our view of the prospectivity of the region, nor of the ongoing regulatory process,” BP’s head of exploration and production in Australia, Claire Fitzpatrick, said in a statement. “It is an outcome of our strategy and the relative competitiveness of this project in our portfolio.” BP has cut its investment budget drastically this year to less than $17 billion, compared with $23 billion two years ago. Exploration activities have been hit particularly hard and a reshuffling of operations led to the departure of its exploration chief four months ago. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets estimate that BP’s exploration spending will fall to $1 billion this year, compared with about $5 billion in 2013. “This decision continues the trend in the sector, with the majors moving away from frontier drilling and towards lower-risk, nearer-return prospects,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria said. BP did not disclose how much the project would have cost or what oil price it needs to make the project viable. Benchmark Brent crude prices were trading at less than $53 a barrel on Tuesday, compared with more than $90 two years ago. Shares in BP were virtually unchanged at 1055 GMT, slightly outperforming a 0.1 percent decline for the sector index. BP was forced to revise its Bight plans late last year and was awaiting decisions by the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority on two wells this month and a broader environmental plan by the end of the year. The agency said on Tuesday that it had yet to receive a request from BP to withdraw its application. The Wilderness Society, which has long fought to stop drilling in the Great Australian Bight area that also contains a protected marine park, on Tuesday urged the federal government to terminate BP’s leases and cancel all exploration permits in the basin. “We should not be expanding the fossil fuel industry into pristine treacherous seas where the risk of spills is far greater than we’ve seen before,” the society’s national director, Lyndon Schneiders, said in a statement. Others with exploration permits include Chevron Corp, Karoon Gas Australia and Murphy Oil in conjunction with Santos. Karoon, which won an exploration permit only last week, described the Bight as Australia’s “most active and prospective frontier oil exploration province”. Industry consultant Wood Mackenzie has estimated that the area could hold 1.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent, making it a potentially major resource. BP said that Statoil, a 30 percent partner in the exploration licences for four blocks in the Bight, had accepted its decision to withdraw.

574,2019-02-19,2019,2.0,19,,"BP to ramp up Azeri Shah Deniz gas output, sees flat ACG oil production","BAKU, Feb 19 (Reuters) - BP plans to ramp up production at Azerbaijan's Shah Deniz gas field and keep output flat at the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) oilfields this year, a senior regional official at the British oil major said. A BP-led consortium said last week that it produced on average 584,000 barrels per day of oil at ACG last year, a total of 29 million tonnes, almost unchanged from 2017 volumes. Natural gas production from the Shah Deniz offshore field was 11.5 billion cubic metres (bcm) and condensate output came to 2.5 million tonnes, up from 10.2 bcm of gas and 2.4 million tonnes of condensate in 2017. ""We expect flat oil production from ACG and a rise in gas production at Shah Deniz in 2019 as we will continue to ramp up production on Shah Deniz throughout this year and ... in the next few years,"" Bakhtiyar Aslanbayli, BP's vice president for Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, told Reuters. He said the giant ACG oilfields, which have so far produced 3.5 billion barrels of oil, had the potential to yield another 3 billion barrels. BP and Azerbaijan in 2017 extended to 2050 their agreement to develop the ACG fields, a deal dubbed by the Azeri government as ""the contract of the century"" when first signed in 1994. The arrangement was initially due to run until 2024. Aslanbayli said a final investment decision regarding exploration and production on the east and central Azeri field envisaged by the extended contract would be made in the first half of this year. MAINTENANCE AND DRILLING PLANS Aslanbayli said the BP-led consortium planned two maintenance shutdowns of platforms at the central Azeri and west Chirag oilfields this year for a couple of weeks each, but both events were envisaged in production forecasts. He said the first gas from the second stage of Azerbaijan's giant Shah Deniz field would be delivered to markets in Europe on time, in 2020. ""We are quite confident that we will be able to deliver gas from Shah Deniz II to Europe next year as it was planned,"" he said. The Shah Deniz I field has been pumping gas since 2006, while output from Shah Deniz II is expected to reach 16 bcm of natural gas per year, with 10 bcm earmarked for Europe and 6 bcm for Turkey. Aslanbayli said the capacity of pipelines along the Southern Gas Corridor running from Azerbaijan to Europe could be expanded if and when additional volumes of gas become available. ""That could be new sources of supply from Azerbaijan, from other fields,"" he said. He called the Shafag-Asiman gas field ""promising"" and said BP planned to drill the first exploration well there this year. ""If everything is as promising as we expect, the Shafag-Asiman will actually have huge gas resources, which could be definitely comparable to Shah Deniz,"" he said. He added that the company would drill two exploration wells in shallow waters off the Absheron peninsula and conduct testing exploration drilling on the Gobustan onshore oilfield later this year.

Graphic: BP Third-Quarter Profits - tmsnrt.rs/2P25Zqn The results further underscore a striking shift in BP over the past year as it shakes off the legacy of the deadly 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster with new projects and the BHP deal, its largest acquisition in 20 years. In a further sign of confidence, BP said it now expected to fully fund the acquisition from available cash without resorting to a rights issue as planned. It still plans to sell $5-$6 billion of assets to reduce debt. “We’re a bit cautious to use the words ‘blow out’ when talking about BP, but today’s results are just that,” Bernstein analyst Oswald Clint said in a note. BP shares were up 3.4 percent by 0914 GMT, compared with a 1 percent rise in the broader European oil and gas sector. The rise in oil prices over the past year to their highest since late 2014 has boosted revenue for oil companies such as BP. Coupled with deep cost cuts and stricter spending since the 2014 downturn, the sector has enjoyed rapid growth in profits. BP’s third-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, the company’s definition of net income, rose to $3.8 billion, far exceeding forecasts of $2.85 billion based on a company-provided survey of analysts. That compared with a profit of $1.86 billion a year earlier and $2.8 billion in the second quarter of 2018. The profit increase came as production in the first nine months of the year rose thanks to new fields and high oil and gas field reliability. Underlying pretax profit for BP’s upstream business more than doubled to around $4 billion in the quarter compared with a year ago. “We’re seeing a backdrop of a strong and well-performing business,” Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary told Reuters. “We’re confident within the financial frame we can close this transaction with all cash,” Gilvary said. Oil and gas production for the first nine months of the year increased to 2.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) and was set to rise further with the expected completion of the BHP deal on Oct. 31. BP launched nine major oil and gas fields over the past year, including in Azerbaijan, Oman, Egypt and Angola that will help boost production by 900,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) by 2021. Most of the production will be gas. The BHP deal is set to initially add over 100,000 boed in production before disposals, which will mostly include predominantly onshore U.S. shale gas producing assets that BP already owns, Gilvary said. Gearing, the ratio between debt and BP’s market value, declined to 27.5 percent at the end of the quarter from 27.8 percent at the end of June. Net debt was $39.2 billion at the end of September. Gilvary said that gearing could temporarily rise next year above the 30 percent limit the company had set, depending on oil prices, as it pays for the BHP deal. In the fourth quarter, BP expects lower refining margins and more refinery turnarounds mainly at its Whiting site in the United States. BP expects its capex in 2018 to be around $15 billion. BP’s operating cash flow, excluding payments for the Deepwater Horizon spill, was $6.6 billion, the same as last year.

578,2019-03-25,2019,3.0,25,"Devika  Krishna Kumar, Jessica Resnick-Ault","U.S. buyers of Venezuelan oil sub in Shell, BP offshore crude","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry have made winners out of Gulf of Mexico offshore heavyweights Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc as U.S. refiners in need of substitutes are scooping up oil produced in the region. The two major oil companies produce notable amounts of crude oil that refiners have settled on as the immediate replacement for the heavy Venezuelan crude that U.S. refiners relied on for years. Trading volumes in these grades of oil have surged to the highest in months, and prices touched five-year peaks since U.S. sanctions were imposed late in January. U.S. production has surged to a record 12 million barrels per day, but less than 5 percent of that is heavy oil. The sanctions have hamstrung refineries in the United States, as many giant Gulf Coast facilities need heavier oil to produce high-margin refined products like diesel and jet fuel. Heavy crude accounts for nearly two-thirds of U.S. oil imports. Of that, Venezuela’s oil accounted for 10 percent of heavy crude imports in 2018 and about 13 percent in 2017, according to U.S. Energy Department figures. Offshore Gulf oil prices - mostly Mars crude , considered the benchmark U.S. sour crude grade - have hit five-year highs, and sales are up sharply, according to company executives, market participants and data reviewed by Reuters. “We’re buying more Mars for the current time,” said Marathon Petroleum Corp Chief Executive Gary Heminger. Marathon, one of the nation’s largest refiners, was not a major importer of Venezuelan crude. “Since we’re exporting so much in the light sweet crude markets, you’re going to have to bring in more medium sours.” Shell operates the most Gulf platforms and BP has the highest volume of output from the region, according to figures provided by the companies. Representatives from the companies would not explicitly link the recent boost in sales of offshore crude to Venezuela’s sanctions, though they did acknowledge the market’s interest. “We do understand that Mars crude is perceived well in the market right now. We’re happy for that and we take advantage of that,” said Rick Tallant, Shell’s vice president of deepwater Gulf of Mexico production. Production in the Gulf of Mexico rose to a record 1.7 million bpd in 2018, and is expected to exceed 2 million bpd in the fourth quarter, according to U.S. Energy Department figures. Sanctions have intensified the need for the oil that is being pumped out of these vast fields. Gulf production averaged 1.89 million bpd in March, up nearly 145,000 bpd from February, said Jodi Quinnell, oil analyst at Genscape. Graphic: U.S. buyers of Venezuelan oil sub in offshore crude - tmsnrt.rs/2HE1rTc Mars generally refers to a medium sour grade of oil produced from the Mars platform, a joint venture between majority owner Shell and BP, located about 130 miles (210 km) off the coast of New Orleans. Refiners, including Valero Energy Corp and Marathon, have been scooping up Mars from Shell’s trading unit in the weeks following the sanctions, sources familiar with the deals said. Other refiners, such as Phillips 66, were also seen buying Southern Green Canyon crude (SGC), a grade similar to Mars, from Shell. Trading in those grades has surged. Volumes in the Argus Sour Crude Index (ASCI), a tool reflecting prices of three U.S. deepwater sour crudes including Mars, rose to 614,036 contracts for February, the most in nearly a year, data from price reporting agency Argus Media show. Volumes in Mars for February delivery rose to 410,536 contracts, the highest since August 2018, the data showed. Prices of other offshore grades such as Thunder Horse, Bonito and SGC also surged to the highest in five years after sanctions took effect. Phillips 66 declined to comment and Valero did not respond to requests for comment. In an auction of federal offshore leases last week, Shell submitted the most high bids for Gulf leases, winning 87 tracts of land valued at more than $84 million. BP grabbed the third-most parcels, winning 23 parcels priced at more than $15 million. Shell’s pipeline partnership, Shell Midstream Partners, shipped 10 percent more crude on the Mars system to the Gulf Coast last year. Both Shell’s Tallant and BP’s regional president for the Gulf of Mexico and Canada Starlee Sykes said their companies were continuing to actively invest in the Gulf, where they say crude can be produced at levels that were cost-competitive with that from onshore shale formations. With several new projects slated to come online as soon as this year, U.S. refiners could replace a good deal of heavy and medium-crude imports with Gulf barrels, said Sandy Fielden, director of commodities & energy research at Morningstar. “Because of their proximity and ease of access to this market, Gulf producers have a natural advantage selling new output to Gulf Coast refiners,” he said.

580,2019-03-01,2019,3.0,1,,FOCUS-Norway's Aker BP switching gears from M&A to exploration,"* Aker BP controlled by Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Roekke * Has relied on acquisitions to add most of its new barrels * Now stepping up exploration drive as drilling costs fall * Emblematic of new industry-wide approach to exploration OSLO, March 1 (Reuters) - Norwegian oil and gas company Aker BP is switching emphasis from M&A towards exploration, taking a potentially riskier path to increase its resources after years when it has relied on acquisitions to add the bulk of its new barrels. The company said the change of tack was prompted by falling exploration costs, partly as a result of new technologies, as well as the rising cost of acquisitions in the energy sector because of stronger oil prices. ""Back in 2015-2016, we acquired resources for 50-60-70 cents a barrel, which is really hard to drill out on the Norwegian continental shelf,"" CEO Karl Johnny Hersvik told Reuters in an interview. ""Now, when the drilling and the (seismic) data acquisition cost have come down, and the acquisition costs of the equivalent contingent resources have gone up, it makes sense (to explore)."" Aker BP has added three times more barrels in oil and gas resources through acquisitions than it has found itself since the company was born about three years ago, Reuters calculations show. The company said it could still make acquisitions if opportunities arose, but declined to make any projections on how many barrels it could buy. Acquisitions - ""inorganic growth"" - contributed more than 500 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) in resources in 2016-18, according to the calculations based on the company's annual reserve reports and investor presentations. Aker BP's own exploration efforts during that period were far smaller: the firm added 148 million boe from discoveries - 83 million in 2016, 10 million in 2017 and 55 million last year. It cost $1.1 a barrel after tax to find new resources last year. The company, controlled by Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Roekke and 30 percent owned by BP, said in January it was hiking its exploration budget by 40 percent year-on-year to a record $500 million in 2019 and planned to drill 15 exploration wells. It aims to find around 100 million boe net in 2019-20. Its sharpened focus on exploration is, to some extent, emblematic of a wider industry trend of companies beginning to step up drilling efforts - which were curbed after the 2014 market crash - as a result of technological advances and stronger oil prices. It could however be a riskier path for Aker BP, whose rapid growth driven largely by M&A helped it weather the downturn better than many peers and has seen its share price more than triple since 2016. The company, which is solely focused on the Norwegian continental shelf, has had a mixed exploration record. It found a quarter of all new resources on the shelf in 2016, but the following year was disappointing. ""We have drilled too many dry wells,"" Aker BP's exploration chief Evy Gloerstad-Clark told Reuters. ""If we want to get to the top we need to get a better exploration processes in place."" But Aker BP and other firms, including Sweden's Lundin Petroleum Norway's largest firm Equinor, are facing a similar challenge: discoveries on the Norwegian continental shelf are getting smaller and smaller. INDUSTRY CHANGE Aker BP's strategy during the downturn contrasted with that of its closest rival on the continental shelf, fellow mid-tier player Lundin, which stuck to a plan of organic growth via exploration. Lundin added only 21.5 million boe from discoveries in 2016-2018, its investor presentations showed. Lundin's share price growth has lagged Aker BP's - but the stock has still doubled since 2016, bolstered by reserve revisions at the giant Johan Sverdrup field which the firm found in 2010 and is due to start producing this year. Aker BP's exploration push reflects a sector-wide change in investor sentiment, according to Teodor Sveen-Nilsen at Sparebank 1 Markets. ""With the upturn in the cycle, investors are more focusing on exploration and reserve replacement than a few years ago, when all the focus was on return on capital and dividends."" French oil company Total is launching its biggest exploration drive for years in 2019, for example, while Chinese oil majors are also stepping up drilling. NEW PROSPECTS Aker BP's CEO Hersvik said a lesson from past exploration failures was not to put all bets on one or two areas, and to do better homework to pinpoint the best spots to drill. The company said it would spend about 40 percent of its exploration budget targeting new prospects, while 60 percent will go to drill near its existing hubs. Gloerstad-Clark also said Aker BP was working to better visualise its drilling and seismic data using specialised software, but this was taking time. The Norwegian continental shelf is proving an increasingly challenging environment for explorers. In 2011-2017, discoveries averaged under 10 million boe, compared with about 110 million boe in the early years of Norway's oil industry in 1966-1980. Aker BP started out in 2016, when Norwegian oil firm Det norske bought British major BP's Norway business in an all-share deal, with BP taking a 30-percent stake, two years after Det norske acquired the Norwegian assets of Marathon Oil . As a result of these and subsequent deals, including the acquisition of Hess' Norwegian assets in 2017, Aker BP's contingent resources - proven resources that could be tapped - tripled to 946 million boe between 2016 and 2018. The company has also amassed a large acreage to explore, with stakes in 156 production licences. Jefferies analyst Mark Wilson said Aker BP's shift towards exploration was a logical step in the company's development, helped by Norway's favourable tax regime. ""It's a natural evolution that makes sense, but the proof will be in the pudding,"" he added.

582,2016-03-04,2016,3.0,4,"Dmitry Zhdannikov, Ron Bousso",BP boss gets 20 percent rise in total pay despite firm's $6.5 billion loss,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP (BP.L) Chief Executive Bob Dudley’s total pay rose 20 percent to nearly $20 million in 2015, a year when the oil major settled most of its U.S. oil spill litigations but also posted a record loss as crude prices plummeted. BP has slashed thousands of jobs and sharply cut investments over the past year in the face of the market downturn, while reaching a landmark $20 billion settlement to resolve most claims from its deadly 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Dudley’s pay has risen steadily since he took office following the spill and has become a regular point of tension with shareholders. The firm’s annual shareholder meeting is scheduled for April. Last month BP reported a $6.5 billion loss for 2015 as its underlying replacement cost profit, its definition of net income, dropped to $5.9 billion in 2015 from $12.1 billion the previous year. BP argues it needs to remain competitive and its remuneration is lower than most U.S. rivals. In its annual report on Friday, BP said executive directors received no increase in base salary in 2015 and that senior leadership would not see salary increases this year either. Dudley’s total pay was boosted by a payment to his U.S. pension scheme and that rise stems from deferred bonus payments, the company said. Ann Dowling, chair of BP’s remuneration committee, said the company delivered strong operating and safety performances throughout 2015. The company’s operating cash flow and underlying replacement cost profit were both well ahead of targets set for 2015, BP said. “The oil price is outside BP’s control, but executives performed strongly in managing the things they could control and for which they are accountable. BP surpassed expectations on most measures and directors’ remuneration reflects this,” Dowling said in the report. BP said that while industry costs had come down sharply following the near 70 percent decline in oil prices over the past 20 months, “this will be a tough period of intense change for the industry as it adapts to this new reality.” BP has said it expects oil prices to remain low in the near term. Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said in the current low oil price environment BP aimed to ensure it covered capital expenditure and shareholder distributions with operating cash flow. “We anticipate that all the actions we are taking will capture more deflation and drive the point of rebalance to below $60 per barrel,” he said. BP’s oil and gas proved reserve replacement ratio dropped for a second year to 61 percent, compared with 63 percent in 2014, indicating that the company has not discovered or acquired sufficient reserves to offset production and the natural decline of wells. The fall was due to a low number of final investment decisions adding new projects and reduced activity in Alaska and the U.S. Lower 48” states, BP said.

The No Oil Producting and Exporting Cartels Act, or NOPEC, would make it illegal under U.S. law for foreign nations to work together to limit fossil fuel supplies and set prices. It would authorize the Justice Department to sue oil-producing nations for antitrust violations, by removing their sovereign immunity protections. ""I think the idea of opening global litigation against the OPEC countries has enormous unpredictable, unintentional consequences,"" said Dudley in response to a question at the annual IHS Markit CERAWeek annual energy conference in Houston. The legislation brought up in the House Judiciary Committee was a hot topic of discussion at CERAWeek. ""I think reason will prevail,"" Dudley said. Critics of the bill say it could backfire and create problems for U.S. companies operating in foreign markets. A bipartisan group of Congressmen on the House Judiciary Committee cleared the bill for a full House vote. Before it could become law, it would have to pass the House, the Senate and then be signed into law by President Donald Trump. ""The role of OPEC in my view has kept the price of oil within a reasonable fairway for producers and consumers and I think that's the important role OPEC will continue to play,"" he told CNBC. ""Otherwise you'll end up with enormous overproduction and crashes in the price. Then it will come back up and then it will soar because there's been underinvestment. I think that's the essential role that OPEC plays."" Others in the industry agree that the bill would be damaging. ""If that happens, it's a risk to anyone with assets in the U.S.,"" said David Goldwyn, chairman of the energy advisory board at the Atlantic Council.

The 63-year old, who took the helm shortly after the 2010 deadly Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico, has overseen a large expansion in the company's production in recent years. Dudley's wages and those of other executives in the sector have nevertheless come under growing scrutiny from investors, particularly following the 2014 collapse in oil prices. His 2017 remuneration was revised up to $15.1 million from the previously reported $13.4 million due to changes in the value of BP's shares over the period. The drop in the 2018 package was the result of a reduced annual bonus and pension, which was partly offset by a rise in BP's share price, the company said in its 2018 annual report. Dudley's 2016 pay package was cut by 40 percent after a majority of shareholders opposed the company's pay policy. Royal Dutch Shell CEO Ben van Beurden saw his pay package more than double to 20.1 million euros ($22.8 million) in 2018, mainly thanks to a bonus and an incentive plan for delivering on targets. It was the second highest pay on record for van Beurden since he became CEO in 2014. Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne, on the other hand, saw his proposed salary reduced to 3.1 million euros ($3.6 million) from 3.8 million in 2017. After settling the vast majority of payments for the 2010 spill, totaling nearly $70 billion, BP has more recently focused on growing production into the next decade, including the $10.5 billion purchase of BHP Billiton's U.S. shale assets, BP's largest deal in 30 years.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/29/bp-ceo-dudleys-2018-pay-slips-to-14point7-million.html,Oil,CNBC

594,2019-04-11,2019,4.0,11,,BP latest oil major to exit China's shale gas after poor drilling results,"SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE, April 11 (Reuters) - European oil major BP plans to exit from two production sharing contracts (PSC) for projects drilling for shale gas in the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan, three sources with the knowledge of the matter said this week. BP is the last of the international oil majors, including Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and ENI, to quit exploring for shale gas in China because of poor drilling results. Its departure leaves the sector firmly in the hands of domestic companies. In March 2016, BP agreed with China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) to explore and produce natural gas from shale rock formations in the Neijiang-Dazu block in Sichuan, its first such contract in China. It inked a second PSC on the Rongchangbei block later in 2016. CNPC was the operator in both deals. BP no longer wants to proceed with the Sichuan projects after drilling eight to 10 wells with disappointing results, two of the three sources said. One of the wells, the Wei 206-H1 that was drilled to a depth of 4,368 metres (14,300 feet) in the Neijiang-Dazu block, produced about 10,000 cubic metres a day of gas during test production, a fraction of the output from a typical CNPC shale gas well in the same geological zone, IHS Markit said in a research note. China is only just beginning to develop its vast shale gas resources with production last year making up only 6 percent of total natural gas output, because of geology that makes gas extraction difficult and a challenging operating environment. With BP and the other oil majors gone, PetroChina Co , CNPC's listed arm, and Sinopec Corp are likely to dominate China's shale gas sector using low-cost technology and services developed domestically. BP's Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said last week at a conference in Shanghai that the Sichuan projects faced ""great challenges"" because of its complex geology. To overcome those problems, BP used technology from its shale developments in the United States at the Sichuan site, Chinese business news portal The Paper reported. BP did not immediately respond to request for comment. PetroChina declined to comment. Zhu Kunfeng, a Beijing-based associate director of upstream research with IHS Markit, said poor economics are the key reason holding BP back from pursuing further in Sichuan. ""As the last trial for IOCs on China's shale gas, BP's decision will impact foreign firms' confidence in China's shale gas sector,"" Zhu said.

Shell, the field's operator, announced plans last year to expand a gas hub around Shearwater, including the construction of a new pipeline. Shell has a 28 percent stake in Shearwater, BP holds 27.5 percent and Exxon Mobil has the remaining 44.5 percent. For BP, a sale would mark a step towards its target of selling $5 to $6 billion of assets following its $10.5 billion purchase of BHP's shale oil and gas portfolio in the United States last year. Shell and BP, which both declined to comment, have held talks in recent weeks and are close to an agreement although the deal could still fall through, two of the sources said. Both Shell and BP have sold a large number of assets in the ageing North Sea basin in recent years. But at the same time they are investing heavily in new projects in the region, particularly in the West of Shetlands area, as technology and cost cuts open new opportunities that were once considered too expensive. Shearwater, located 225 kilometres (140 miles) east of Aberdeen, was discovered in 1988 and first developed in 2000. At peak production, the gas export capacity of the Shearwater hub is expected to be around 400 million standard cubic feet of gas a day, or roughly 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, according to Shell.

BP purchased BHP Billiton's U.S. shale assets for $10.5 billion last year, giving the oil major a foothold in the Permian Basin and other regions where drillers extract oil and gas from rock formations. BP took over those operations last month. ""We've got our plate full. It's the biggest acquisition we've done in 20 years,"" Dudley told CNBC's Brian Sullivan at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California. ""So I think we're fine, not on the hunt, but this doesn't surprise me we're starting to see some of the consolidation in the Permian,"" he said, referring to the top U.S. shale oil region stretching from western Texas to southeastern New Mexico. Anadarko's acreage in the Permian is widely seen as the company's crown jewel and the biggest prize for the winning bidder. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway entered the fray on Tuesday, committing to a $10 billion investment in Occidental to help the driller acquire Anadarko. Dudley said BP would not put in a bid to rival Chevron's and Occidental's offers for Anadarko. Dudley expects oil and gas companies to continue striking deals and swapping acreage in order to string together continuous strips of land in the Permian. Before the BHP purchase, BP's onshore U.S. operations mostly produced natural gas.

That compared with a profit of $2.6 billion a year earlier and $3.5 billion in the final three months of 2018. It marks the first significant setback in BP's steady recovery over the past 18 months. ""It was a pretty resilient set of results actually given the environment we came into at the start of the year,"" Brian Gilvary, chief financial officer at BP, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday.

""I think oil prices look pretty firm given where we are today but we are going to continue to maintain capital discipline,"" he added. Shares of BP rose almost 1% during morning deals. Profits from refining and retail operations, known as downstream, tumbled by around 20% amid weaker margins and narrower discounts of heavy crude oil.

""Now the U.S. is saying they're going to ... take away those waivers again, and the oil price is clearly drifting up because of that,"" he told CNBC's Brian Sullivan during an interview at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, on Tuesday. ""I think the key — the wild card key — is will the U.S. at the last minute give some more waivers or not?"" Dudley said. The answer to that question will influence whether oil prices rise or fall, he said. While the Trump administration insists there will be no grace period for Iranian oil buyers, it has surprised the market on more than one occasion. Trump's threat to impose tough sanctions on Iran drove Brent crude oil to nearly four-year highs at $86 a barrel last October, according to Dudley. The president's decision to allow several of Iran's biggest customers to continue importing Iranian barrels in November contributed to Brent's collapse to $50 a barrel, he said. Last week, the Trump administration said it will stop issuing the exemptions on May 2. The market widely expected Trump to extend them for another six months, tightening the waivers but not ending them outright. Analysts are still trying to determine how many Iranian barrels will come off the market. China and Turkey, two countries that received waivers, have condemned the U.S. sanctions and are widely expected to seek ways to continue importing Iranian oil. Oil prices plunged Friday after Trump said he had ""called up"" OPEC and told the producer group to take measures to tame gasoline prices. U.S. officials say they have secured pledges from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to fill the gap left by Iranian supplies, but the OPEC members have not explicitly committed to pumping more oil. Crude futures have clawed back some gains this week after Saudi and OPEC sources denied that Trump spoke to top officials about cutting fuel costs. Prices also got a boost after Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih suggested on Tuesday that OPEC could extend a deal to cap output through the end of 2019. The plunge in oil production in Venezuela, which is under U.S. sanctions, has also contributed to the run-up in oil prices, Dudley said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/01/trumps-iran-policy-is-the-key-wildcard-for-oil-says-bps-bob-dudley.html,Energy,CNBC

But some investors want BP to go further and follow the lead of rival Royal Dutch Shell, which bowed to years of lobbying and set the toughest industry targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. ""BP now is at the same stage as Shell was two to three years ago,"" said Eric Rutten, head of the responsible investments committee of Aegon, BP's biggest Dutch investor with shares worth $26 million in the $142 billion firm, Refinitiv data show.  His investment company is backing a resolution drawn up by activist group Follow This that would require BP to reduce emissions not just from its own activities but also from the fuel and products it sells to customers.

The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) on Monday published an investigation alleging that in a previously unpublished arrangement, BP agreed to pay Timis Corporation, a company run by Romanian-Australian tycoon Frank Timis, around $10 billion in royalty payments for its stake in the blocks. The report said the early history of the acreage, which contains one of the largest deposits of gas in the world, was mired by fraud involving Timis, who has mining and energy interests across Africa. The BBC alleged that Timis in 2014 secretly paid $250,000 to a company run by Aliou Sall called Agritrans, based on a trove of documents it reviewed. It said Timis also paid Aliou Sall $1.5 million in salary over five years for his work in Petro-Tim, the company originally given the blocks before Timis Corporation, and that he was also offered $3 million in shares in Timis companies. Aliou Sall denied receiving the $250,000 payment from Timis and called the BBC's report ""totally false."" BP said in a statement that it ""rejects any implication that it acted improperly in the acquisition of our interests in Senegal"" and that it ""conducted extensive and appropriate due diligence"" before acquiring the license. It said the $10 billion figure quoted by the BBC was ""wholly inaccurate."" Timis was not reachable for comment, but he told the BBC in a statement that there had been ""no wrongdoing whatsoever."" Senegal's offshore oil and gas reserves have the potential to transform the impoverished West African country when they start flowing in the next decade, likely in volumes rivaling some of the region's biggest producers.

Soon after, the president's brother was hired at the company. Protests against the deal erupted in the capital Dakar in 2016, casting a shadow over Sall's first term.

The justices took up Atlantic Richfield Co's appeal of a lower court ruling allowing a lawsuit by a group of property owners within the sprawling site of its former Anaconda copper smelter in western Montana to proceed to trial.

It was designated a Superfund site in 1983 to reduce arsenic contamination in residential yards, pastures and ground water. The landowners sued in state court to restore their properties to pre-smelter conditions. Atlantic Richfield said such state law claims were barred by the EPA's actions under the 1980 Superfund law, called the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. The company also said the suit was prohibited under the U.S. Constitution's so-called Supremacy Clause, which holds that federal law generally trumps state law. In 2017, the Montana Supreme Court, the state's highest court, ruled against Atlantic Richfield, allowing the case to move forward. Appealing to the Supreme Court, Atlantic Richfield said that decision could undermine the already-complex Superfund regime and leave companies open to thousands more lawsuits. It also could be forced to redo its work at the Anaconda site, the company said. ""This is the very definition of madness,"" the company said in a legal brief. President Donald Trump's administration has said the Montana court improperly ruled in favor of the landowners but agreed that the case should proceed to trial before the justices hear it. Also on Monday, the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal by Canada's Teck Resources Ltd of a lower federal court's decision holding the company liable under the Superfund law for pollution that settled in Washington state from a smelter in British Columbia. The company said the law cannot be applied outside U.S. borders.

616,2019-06-12,2019,6.0,12,,StoreDot and BP charge an electric scooter in just five minutes,"Israel's StoreDot is making major headway in its bid to charge up devices in a matter of minutes with new battery technology. The Herzliya-based start-up's lithium-ion battery on Tuesday managed to recharge an electric scooter from Spanish firm Torrot in just five minutes. It completed the demonstration alongside oil major BP, a strategic backer of the company. The companies claim this is the first time an electric two-wheeler has been charged in such a short amount of time. ""What we are demonstrating with the scooter is the capability of the technology,"" Doron Myersdorf, StoreDot's CEO, told CNBC in an interview Tuesday. Myersdorf added it's the first time the company has showed off five-minute charging with a battery pack containing so many cells — this one contains 168 in total. In addition to BP, StoreDot also counts Mercedes owner Daimler and tech giant Samsung as investors. It previously attracted headlines with its cell phone battery which, again, boasts five-minute charging. ""We are developing a new generation of lithium-ion batteries,"" said Myersdorf. ""More specifically, we are eliminating the use of graphite in the battery."" The company's chief explained that the reason behind taking graphite out of the equation is that the mineral doesn't work as well at charging devices quickly. Each morning, the “Beyond the Valley” newsletter brings you all the latest from the vast, dynamic world of tech – outside the Silicon Valley. Instead, the firm is using materials like tin, germanium and silicon in combination with organic compounds that it claims are a better solution for lithium-ion batteries than the cells used in most consumer electronics currently. StoreDot finds itself in a heated race with a multitude of companies looking to address the problem of slow recharging times for electric vehicles. Porsche recently unveiled an electric car that can add 60 miles of range from a four-minute charge, while start-ups including Sila Nanotechnologies and QuantumScape are also trying to shake up the battery market. StoreDot's latest demo is the ""first step"" toward eventually charging electric cars and even trucks at super-fast speeds, Myersdorf said. It's looking to demo five-minute charging with Mercedes cars in a year's time. The firm expects five-minute smartphone and power bank charging to be available in the second half of 2020, while fast charging for electric cars likely won't come onto the market until 2023, StoreDot's boss said. It's also looking to set up a battery-making plant similar to Tesla's Gigafactory, called OneGiga. Myserdorf said StoreDot is currently in talks with U.S. authorities to work out an ideal location for the facility. Companies like BP and Daimler have had to wake up to the slow-burning shift toward electrification, as global pressure to prioritize clean energy over fossil fuels ramps up amid concerns over climate change. ""Electric vehicles will play a major role in the future of road transport, and that's why BP is investing in technology and infrastructure,"" said Jon Salked, technology director at BP's advanced mobility unit. ""Electrification presents exciting opportunities for businesses like BP and we see possibilities to expand and complement our business offerings.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/12/storedot-and-bp-charge-an-electric-scooter-in-just-five-minutes.html,Tech,CNBC

618,2019-06-27,2019,6.0,27,,UPDATE 1-EXCLUSIVE-Trade tensions put energy transition at risk- BP chairman,"* BP prefers rapid energy transition to disarray-Lund * World needs oil companies to remain good investment-Lund * Lund says has no plan to become BP CEO when Dudley retires (Adds quote in paragraph 30) LONDON, June 27 (Reuters) - Trade tensions risk throwing the global economy's transition to greener energy into disarray and could hurt energy companies' preparations towards it, BP Chairman Helge Lund said as leaders of the world's largest economies gather for talks in Japan. Lund, in his first interview since taking office in January, said BP would rather see a rapid, orderly phasing out of fossil fuels than a delayed and disorganised transition. The former chief executive of Norwegian oil group Equinor said BP as well as rivals such as Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil would have a vital role to play to ensure a successful transition to low carbon economies. ""It is better for us to see a path that goes rapidly,"" Lund said. ""It will be very difficult for the oil and gas companies but that is a better and a preferred solution than an uncontrolled sudden change maybe 10, 15 years into the future."" London-based BP, like some of its peers, has taken steps towards meeting the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement to limit global warming, including setting targets to reduce carbon emissions from its operations, link them to managers' pay and ensure that investments are in line with the accords. But many investors say BP will have to do more, including tackling emissions from the fuels and products it sells to millions of customers daily, known as Scope 3 emissions, to prevent a catastrophic rise in global temperatures. Lund said however that such Scope 3 targets would tie BP's hands to make future investments, whether in renewable energy or oil and gas. He nevertheless said the company's thinking around Scope 3 was likely ""to evolve over time."" BP invested around $500 million in renewable power, electric vehicle charging points and other low-carbon technologies last year, a fraction of its annual spending of $15 billion. And the pressure on companies and governments to do more to curb greenhouse gases is rising as carbon emission levels show no sign of decreasing. Investors managing more than $34 trillion in assets, nearly half the world's invested capital, this week demanded urgent action from governments on climate change, piling pressure on leaders of the world's 20 biggest economies meeting this week. France has said it will not accept a final G20 communique that does not mention the Paris climate change agreement. ""The long-term framework around the energy transition is important. Over time it is much easier for big companies like BP if we have a stable global framework for trade and investments,"" Lund told Reuters at BP's London headquarters. Lund said an unprecedented level of cooperation was needed between companies and governments to bring greenhouse gas emissions to zero by the end of the century. He urged governments to introduce a price on carbon emissions to allow phasing out fossil fuels, even though only a handful of such schemes have been introduced around the world. SOUND INVESTMENT BP has faced a wave of protests by climate activists, including a blockade on its London office and protests at events the company sponsors. Big investors, including Norway's sovereign wealth fund, are reviewing shareholdings in some oil and gas drillers, though not in BP and its largest rivals. Lund, who took part in discussions on a climate resolution with a group of investors earlier this year, believes most investors understand that modern societies are almost built on hydrocarbons. BP forecasts that even with a rapid increase in wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy, fossil fuels will account for the majority of energy supply for decades to come. Lund also warned that attempts to curb fossil fuels too fast could harm societies. ""It takes time to change energy systems ... If you try to build down the oil and gas industry quicker than you are able to build up a carbon neutral system you will pull societies back."" Lund said large oil companies would be vital for the transition due to their large balance sheets, technical expertise and innovation skills. ""To be a strong contributor in the long term we have to stay financially strong, we have to be a good investment."" Lund also said: There is another dimension that we need to think about and that is if you believe that BP and other integrated oil and gas companies understand energy markets, they have significant balance sheets, they have technical capabilities, they have innovation capabilities, they can take risks - so in my mind business and these companies play an incredibly important role in the energy transition. SUCCESSION Lund, 56, faces the task of leading BP through the energy transition and also overseeing the succession to Chief Executive Bob Dudley, who took the helm in 2010 following the crisis over the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico. Dudley also steered BP through the oil industry's worst downturn in decades so that the company is now producing strong profits which reached a five-year high last year of $12.7 billion. ""Bob is a very good leader, I am not sure where BP would have been without him,"" Helge said. BP's board would ensure that when Dudley, who turns 65 next year, steps down, there will be ""at least a number of candidates who can compete for the job,"" he added. Lund, a former consultant and political adviser in the Norwegian parliament rejected suggestions he could replace Dudley to become the next CEO. ""I've been CEO for three companies. I thought about this when I left BG whether I should try to get one more (CEO) job or try to get a different life and I decided on the latter and I think it is rewarding,"" he said.

Woodfibre said on Wednesday BP Gas Marketing Limited had agreed to buy 0.75 million tonnes per year (mtpa) of LNG for 15 years starting in 2023, when the project in British Columbia is expected to come onstream. The facility's capacity is expected to be 2.1 mtpa. It said it was also working on an agreement ""for BP Canada to provide gas transportation and balancing services ensuring a reliable delivery of gas to the Woodfibre LNG export facility over the 15-year term."" Dozens of companies are planning LNG export terminals in North America to capitalize on gas made accessible from shale drilling technology. Signing up committed, long-term buyers is vital for financing and building such projects. Royal Dutch Shell approved its 14 mtpa project in Kitimat, northern British Columbia, in October, triggering a new cycle of projects to be built to meet an anticipated LNG shortage in mid-2020s. But the LNG Canada project is the only one in Canada to have progressed to construction stage. Woodfibre LNG is a subsidiary of Pacific Oil & Gas, part of the Singaporean conglomerate RGE. Pacific Oil & Gas operates two LNG import terminals in China, as well as other upstream and midstream oil and gas assets. LNG produced on the west coast of Canada is likely to be sold in Asia which accounts for about 75 percent of global demand. There are at least half a dozen LNG export terminal projects planned in Canada, and more in the United States.

The London-based firm, in which BP holds a 43% stake, said in a statement it bought 1.9 gigawatt of projects from independent renewables developer Enerlife for an undisclosed sum. The utility-scale solar projects are at different stages, from early land permits to more advanced developments with grid connections. Solar power contributes just over 1% of Brazil's total electricity generation, which is expected to soar in the coming decades. ""These are the building blocks of which we will grow a very successful solar business across Brazil,"" Lightsource BP Chief Operating Officer Kareen Boutonnat said in a statement. Lightsource will target mainly corporate and industrial buyers in both the regulated and unregulated market, according to Vlasios Souflis, director for international business development. The Brazilian government last week awarded licenses for new power generation projects that would add 402 megawatts (MW) of capacity by 2023 at record-low price for solar generation. Enerlife was awarded over 160 megawatt in five solar projects. Lightsource BP is the largest European utility solar developer with over $3 billion invested across nearly 2 gigawatt of solar projects around the world, according to Lightsource BP's statement. The company has in recent years expanded its operations in the U.S. states of California, Pennsylvania and Maryland as well as in Egypt and India. The Enerlife portfolio consists of 1.9 gigawatts of solar projects, including of 440 megawatt in late stage development as well as 180 megawatt of distributed generation projects across five states, each one up to 5 megawatt capacity, Lightsource BP said.

621,2019-07-12,2019,7.0,12,,UPDATE 1-Aker BP makes oil discovery off Norway,"(Recasts on oil discovery, adds analyst) OSLO, July 12 (Reuters) - Norwegian oil firm Aker BP has made an oil discovery off Norway which could strengthen its hand in negotiations with its sometimes partner Equinor on how to develop fields. Aker-BP is the result of a merger of BP's Norwegian oil assets and the Det norske oil firm controlled by billionaire Kjell-Inge Roekke. The company said on Thursday it had made an oil discovery with partner LOTOS of Poland estimated to hold between 80 million and 200 million barrels of recoverable oil equivalent (boe), in an area with several oil and gas discoveries, nicknamed NOAKA. Up to 700 million boe are in place overall at the discovery, called Liataarnet, but Aker BP needs to do more work to find out how much it can extract, the company said. Aker BP and its partner in some of the NOAKA fields, state-controlled giant Equinor, are at odds about how to develop them. ""This is a clear message to partner Equinor in terms of development solutions for NOAKA. We believe the Liataarnet discovery will improve Aker BP's negotiation position vs. Equinor,"" Sparebank 1 Markets said in a note to clients. Aker BP also said it would slightly increase its capital and exploration spending this year. Spending on exploring new oil and gas fields will rise to $550 million this year, from its previous guidance for $500 million. Capital expenditure is now seen in a range of $1.6-$1.7 billion compared with previous guidance for $1.6 billion. The development of the Johan Sverdrup field was progressing well, Aker BP said. Scheduled to start production in November, it is the biggest oil find made off Norway in more than three decades and is likely to account for 25% of the Nordic country's total petroleum output at its peak in 2022. Overall, Aker's net income fell to $62 million in the second quarter from $128 million a year earlier. Aker BP reported on July 4 that its net sales of oil for had reached 140,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter.

622,2019-07-22,2019,7.0,22,,UPDATE 2-Bunge and BP team up for Brazil sugar and ethanol venture,"(Adds details on deal, analyst view, share performance) SAO PAULO, July 22 (Reuters) - U.S. commodities trader Bunge Ltd and British energy company BP Plc said on Monday they will merge their Brazilian sugar and ethanol operations to create the world's third-largest sugarcane processor. The joint venture is the largest deal in Brazil's bioenergy sector since Royal Dutch Shell joined forces with Cosan to form industry leader Raízen in 2011. Together, Bunge and BP will manage 11 cane processing plants in Brazil, with capacity to crush 32 million tonnes of cane per year, putting them behind just Raízen and Biosev, controlled by commodities trader Louis Dreyfus. The deal gives BP a key role in Brazil's booming ethanol market ahead of a new federal policy next year aimed at boosting use of biofuels, which are used interchangeably with gasoline in Brazilian passenger cars. ""Brazil is the Saudi Arabia of biofuel,"" BP's head of Alternative Energy, Dev Sanyal, told Reuters. He added that the new venture was cash-flow positive. Bunge said it will receive cash proceeds of $775 million as part of the agreement, which it expects to use to cut debt. Bunge shares opened up more than 3% in New York before reducing gains to 1.8%. BP rose 0.7% in London. The U.S.-based company has tried to sell its sugar operation in Brazil in the past with no success. It then tried listing shares of the unit in Sao Paulo last year, but canceled the plan, citing adverse market conditions. Bunge sold its sugar trading business to Wilmar International Ltd in August. Its bioenergy unit posted losses in five of the past six quarters and the company forecast results for the unit would be roughly break-even in 2019. ""This partnership with BP represents a major portfolio optimization milestone for Bunge which allows us to reduce our current exposure to sugar milling,"" Bunge CEO Gregory Heckman said in a statement. Market conditions have improved for ethanol in Brazil, with strong demand and better prices, but the global sugar market remains challenging. ""I think the companies together will be able to have large synergies, there will be great optimization of resources and cost reductions,"" said Arnaldo Corrêa, a sugar and ethanol consultant in Brazil. ""It is great news for the sector, because the deal creates a much stronger player. All those worries about the future of Bunge's assets disappeared,"" he added. The joint venture, named BP Bunge Bioenergia, will operate on a standalone basis, headquartered in Sao Paulo. Besides sugar and ethanol, the company has capacity to produce electricity fueled by waste biomass from sugarcane. ""The new company will certainly focus on fuel and electricity, which will have a growing importance as Brazil's economy recovers,"" said Plinio Nastari, chief analyst at Brazilian consultancy Datagro. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2019.

""It is a good quarter — a strong quarter,"" he added. BP said the quarter's result largely reflected continued good operating performance, offset by oil prices lower than in the second quarter of 2018. International benchmark Brent crude stood at $64.15 Tuesday morning, down more than 14% when compared to the end of the second quarter in 2018. Meanwhile, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) was trading at $57.25 during morning deals, almost 20% lower from a year earlier. The FTSE 100 giant said its upstream and downstream divisions performed strongly in three-month period through to July 30. Production rose 4% to average 3.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Total revenue for the second quarter came in at $73.75 billion, down 4.1% from a year earlier. BP said Gulf of Mexico oil spill payments of $1.4 billion on a post-tax basis in the second quarter were primarily the scheduled annual payments. Shares of BP rose 3% during morning deals. ""Reliable performance and disciplined growth across our businesses are delivering strong earnings, cash flow and returns to shareholders,"" Dudley said. ""And this is also allowing us to grow businesses that can make a significant contribution in the energy transition, helping deliver the energy the world needs with lower carbon."" The company maintained its quarterly dividend at 10.25 cents a share. BP's second-quarter results come after France's Total reported an almost 20% fall in second-quarter adjusted net profit last week. The Paris-listed firm cited unfavorable market conditions for the first-half of the year, including low oil prices, sharp declines in gas prices and sliding refining margins.

626,2019-07-30,2019,7.0,30,,Climate change: BP says activists should avoid polarizing society,"BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley urged climate activists not to ""demonize"" companies, following several weeks of protests designed to highlight how fossil fuels contribute to climate change. The energy giant has been targeted by climate activist groups on numerous occasions in recent months, with demonstrators increasingly angry about the lack of progress toward a lower carbon future. ""I don't think it helps anything to demonize companies or groups. It gets society polarized and it is really hard to move through big complex problems when you set that up,"" BP CEO Bob Dudley told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday. Dudley said he hoped BP would continue to have meaningful dialogue with climate protesters moving forward, before pointing out that ""London seems to be the world center of this strong debate today."" The United Nations (UN) has recognized climate change as ""the defining issue of our time,"" with a recent report calling the crisis ""the greatest challenge to sustainable development."" Since the start of May, climate activists from Greenpeace have blockaded BP's U.K. headquarters, demonstrated outside the company's European base, picketed petrol stations worldwide, spoken out against the company's U.K. arts sponsorship and scaled an oil rig as it was being towed to one of BP's North Sea projects. Greenpeace has urged BP to immediately end exploration projects for new oil and gas and switch to investing only in renewable energy. ""The reality is it is going to take all forms of energy to solve this. One of the groups wants us to go 100% into renewables (but) it has got to be a race to reduce emissions not a race to renewables,"" Dudley said, in an apparent reference to the demands of Greenpeace. ""North of 95% of BP's capital expenditure is on fossil fuels. If Bob Dudley had been spending as much of their shareholders' money looking for a solution to the climate emergency, we'd be much closer to solving the problem,"" Rosie Rogers, who runs the climate emergency campaign at Greenpeace U.K., told CNBC via email on Tuesday. ""The science is crystal clear and leaves oil giants no wiggle room. Either they ditch fossil fuels, or we'll face the full impact of a climate disaster,"" Rogers said. BP believes its approach to lower carbon and reducing emissions is ""embedded "" within its strategy, according to the company's website. In May, the FTSE 100 giant agreed to a request from shareholders for greater detail and transparency on how each capital investment decision would align with the Paris climate agreement — an international accord that seeks to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius. The initiative was adopted after a report published by InfluenceMap in March showed BP was outspending the other largest publicly-owned oil and gas majors to lobby against climate action.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/30/climate-change-bp-says-activists-should-avoid-polarizing-society.html,,CNBC

""A Jeremy Corbyn government, of a kind that does what it says it might do, I think is quite alarming for everybody,"" BP CEO Bob Dudley told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday. ""I think when you talk about nationalizing assets in companies, and particularly think about the bond holders who are global, I mean everyone is sitting up and saying: 'Really?'"" Dudley said. The Labour party did not respond to a request for comment when contacted by CNBC Tuesday morning. Corbyn, the leftist leader of the Labour Party since 2015, reportedly said Sunday that he is ""absolutely"" willing to go up against newly-elected Prime Minister Boris Johnson if a general election is called over the coming months. Britain is not due to hold a nationwide vote until 2022. But, a wafer-thin parliamentary majority for the ruling Conservative Party — with less than 100 days until the world's fifth-largest economy is due to leave the European Union — has led some external observers to believe an election could be called before the October 31 Brexit deadline. Conservative Party leader Boris Johnson, who officially entered Downing Street last week, has vowed to deliver Brexit by that date ""come what may "" — even if that means leaving without a deal in place. In 2017, Labour campaigned on an election manifesto to bring rail companies, energy supply networks, water systems and mail delivery into public ownership. Labour proposed its nationalization program would be led by a ""Public Ownership Unit"" within the finance ministry. The party has said it would compensate shareholders using bonds. It describes that exchange as cost neutral to the public purse because it trades a liability (the bond) for a profitable asset (the companies). It has not specified the nature of these bonds. Corbyn described the manifesto as a throwback to Britain's socialist experiences of the 1970s. ""When you take the extreme statements, of course the business community would worry,"" Dudley said. When asked whether BP would consider moving its headquarters if a Corbyn-led Labour government was elected, Dudley replied: ""We are a great British company. We have no plans to redomicile whatsoever."" The pound, which has been tied to the years-long process of negotiating Britain's exit from the bloc, tumbled toward $1.21 Tuesday afternoon.

Retail services, such as convenience stores at petrol stations, have become a big revenue generator for oil majors such as BP and Royal Dutch Shell with profits often offsetting weakness in oil and gas production. BP operates a fuels and convenience business across 18 countries with more than 18,700 sites. Didi, China's biggest ride-hailing company, runs a mobile transportation platform, offering users app-based options including car-sharing. Didi's platform has 550 million users and more than 600,000 EVs run on it in China, BP said. The venture with BP will develop charging hubs for Didis drivers and the wider public and add convenience stores in the near future, BP said in a statement. The venture could build as many as 200 hubs with multiple charging points by the end of 2020, a BP spokesman said. BP believes the venture can be scaled up to thousands of hubs across China to reach a leading market position with unmanned and remotely controlled sites, separate from BP's roughly 700 retail sites in the country, the spokesman added. ""As the worlds largest EV market, China offers extraordinary opportunities,"" BP quoted its downstream chief, Tufan Erginbilgic, as saying. ""The lessons we learn here will help us further expand BP's advanced mobility business worldwide, helping drive the energy transition and develop solutions for a low-carbon world."" China is the worlds largest EV market, with around 50% of battery electric vehicles globally. In January, BP said it would invest in Chinese start-up PowerShare, which links EV drivers to charging points and helps power suppliers balance distribution. With China targeting sales of more than 7 million EVs by 2025, the need to manage demand and distribution of power on the grid, particularly at times of peak demand, will be crucial. Corporate investors from outside the auto industry are betting on electric vehicles, vying with automakers and suppliers to bankroll companies working on everything from advanced batteries to charging devices and all-new EVs. In Europe, BP bought Britain's top EV charging company Chargermaster last year, with the aim of linking the smaller firm's services with BP petrol stations in the country.

The company announced Thursday that it would form a joint venture with the British oil major aimed at providing charging services to both Didi and non-Didi car owners. BP has already linked its first charging site in the Chinese port city of Guangzhou with Didi's open automobile solutions platform, Didi said in a statement. The Chinese firm pumped $1 billion into its auto services business, called XAS, last year. The aim is to scale up the charging network ""significantly"" in China after the joint venture with BP is established, Didi said. ""We look forward to combining our strengths to create a robust EV charging network for China, promote the growth of the new energy automotive industry, and provide better experience for car owners across the country"" Didi Chairman and CEO Cheng Wei said in a statement.

630,2019-08-08,2019,8.0,8,,"EXCLUSIVE-Iraq close to pipeline deal with BP and Eni, rather than Exxon - sources","sources@ * Iraq poised to award part of huge Exxon project to oil rivals * BP and Eni close to securing $400 mln seabed pipelines deal * Exxon's planned $53 bln deal hit by contract, security snags BASRA, Iraq/BAGHDAD, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Iraq is close to reaching a deal with oil majors BP and Eni for an export pipeline project that was initially planned as part of a mega-deal with U.S. energy giant ExxonMobil, according to five senior Iraqi oil officials involved in the negotiations. Under the proposed $400 million agreement, British company BP and Italy's Eni would run the scheme to build two seabed oil pipelines for Iraq's southern exports through the Gulf, the sources told Reuters, declining to be named as the discussions have not been made public. The pipeline work was meant to be part of a larger, $53 billion project that Exxon looked poised to move ahead with earlier this year, but an agreement with Baghdad was held back by contractual wrangling and security concerns, the officials said. The 30-year mega-project is the focus of Exxon's plans to expand in Iraq, OPEC's second-largest producer, and a chipping away of schemes from the deal could drag on the company's ambitions. The BP and Eni talks with Baghdad follow an announcement from Iraqi officials in June that South Korea's Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co Ltd had been selected to build a $2.4 billion seawater injection facility - another part of the deal originally on the table with Exxon. ExxonMobil and Eni declined to comment, while BP had no immediate comment. In May, Iraq's proposed bumper deal with Exxon appeared imminent. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discussed it with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi twice in three days, including during a surprise visit to Baghdad. Abdul Mahdi, meanwhile, said Iraq was close to signing the agreement with the American company and its venture partner PetroChina. But negotiations subsequently became protracted over contract conditions and escalating tensions between Iraq's bigger neighbour Iran and the United States, Baghdad's two main allies. Talks to reach at least an initial agreement were held up by two separate evacuations of Exxon's foreign staff from Iraq, the first after Washington warned of Iranian threats to U.S. interests there, and the second prompted by a rocket attack that appeared to target the company. The five senior Iraqi oil officials said the delays had forced Iraq to consider other companies to help construct infrastructure for its offshore export terminals. ""We can't wait for Exxon forever. We have serious problems with our sea pipelines and urgently need to find partners to help build new ones. Further delays could harm our sea export infrastructure,"" said one of the officials, who oversees export infrastructure in the south of the country. RUPTURES, LEAKS The project that Iraq is discussing with BP and Eni involves the replacement of two old seabed pipelines, including an idled one which transports crude to the Khor al-Amaya terminal. Loading operations have been halted at Khor al-Amaya since 2017 when the pipeline suffered ruptures and leakages and had to be shut, oil officials said. The other pipeline is operating at partial capacity to ship crude oil to the Basra offshore terminal. Under the proposed deal, BP would finance the project and Eni would handle the procurement, engineering and construction tendering aspects, the sources said. The negotiations are in their final stages after the parties worked out a mechanism to allow the British company to recover its financing payments. ""In principle we agreed BP could recover its payments by taking oil shipments instead of cash, just like the mechanism we're following to pay the company to develop Rumaila oilfields,"" said one of the Iraqi officials. Eni will be paid in cash for its work, the officials said. The seawater injection project, which Hyundai has been selected for, was also originally part of Exxon's planned deal to develop Iraq's southern energy installations. Iraq has no major water injection plant and needs one for its wells or would risk losing pressure and face severe production decline, especially at its mature oilfields. As freshwater is a scarce resource in Iraq, using treated seawater is one of the best alternatives. Three of the oil officials said Exxon had costed the project at higher than Hyundai's $2.4 billion. They said other parts of the proposed Exxon project could go to other companies if they offered lower costs, including a project to build additional crude storage. The Hyundai deal, announced by the state-run Basra Oil Co, still requires the final approval of the oil ministry. One of the officials said the agreement would be finalised before the end of year.

The ""Deepwater Horizon"" film, starring Mark Wahlberg, hits theaters on Friday. Critics have given it good reviews, but fact-checkers have questioned aspects of the story. A Financial Times review says it “tells only a partial version of the story, setting up a simplistic opposition between the heroes of Transocean, which owned and operated the Deepwater Horizon rig, and the villains of BP.”  Both companies have been found at fault for the incident, and Transocean has also paid more than $1 billion to settle lawsuits following the incident.  The film “ignores the conclusions reached by every official investigation: that the accident was the result of multiple errors made by a number of companies,” BP’s statement said.  —This post was updated at 1:39 p.m. View the discussion thread.

The group claimed the company overstated the extent of its safety procedures for drilling rigs, causing them to invest in the company and lose money when BP’s stock collapsed after the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill.  An appeals court had rejected the investors’ class action lawsuit against BP in September, arguing some members of the group might have bought stock in the company regardless of the safety issues, The Legal Intelligencer journal wrote in a summary of the case in January.  BP, too, argued the suit shouldn’t go forward because the investors were asking for damages for the entire decline in stock price, Reuters reports.  The Supreme Court rejected the investors’ appeal without comment on Monday.  ""We are pleased that the Supreme Court has denied the plaintiffs’ petition,” BP spokesman Geoff Morrell said in a statement.   “In multiple previous decisions, the Fifth Circuit and District Court have rejected this proposed class of plaintiffs, all of whom purchased BP stock over a two-and-a-half-year period before the Deepwater Horizon explosion. BP has long argued that all the plaintiffs’ securities claims are meritless and will continue to defend vigorously against them.""  The 2010 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig killed 11 workers and spilled 3.19 million barrel of oil into the Gulf of Mexico.

The decision ends years of litigation over the spill, which released 3.19 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico following the April 10, 2010, explosion at the Deepwater Horizon rig. The explosion killed 11 people. Under the terms of the settlement, announced last July and finalized in October, BP will spend $5.5 billion to settle civil claims against it under the Clean Water Act. The company will also spend $7.1 billion for environmental restoration work, plus $700 million to compensate for still-unknown damages to natural resources in the region. The company will pay $4.9 million to Gulf Coast states affected by the spill, as well as $1 billion to local communities. Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas will split that portion of the settlement. The settlement is the largest with a single entity in Justice Department history. The federal government sued BP over its role in the Gulf spill in December 2010, and several states damaged by the spill soon followed. Litigation against the company has been extensive, and before the final settlement was announced, BP and its partners had already settled several claims related to the spill, including $1 billion in restoration work incorporated into the final deal. BP had originally faced a Clean Water Act penalty of more than $13 billion, though the federal government would have needed to steer such a penalty through the courts.   “The steep penalty should inspire BP and its peers to take every measure necessary to ensure that nothing like this can ever happen again,” Attorney General Lynch said in October while announcing the final ruling. —This post was updated at 5:12 p.m. View the discussion thread.

The figure, released late Thursday, is $5.2 billion higher than the most recent estimate, BP said in a statement. The total includes numerous payments, legal costs, cleanup costs and other expenses related to the Deepwater Horizon disaster, the biggest offshore oil spill in U.S. history, including a $20.8 billion settlement with the federal government and five states, the largest for the federal government in history. BP has also agreed to pay to settle criminal charges and accusations that it underestimated the size of the spill, as well as payments for private property and economic damages. An explosion killed 11 workers when the rig lost control of the undersea well. It was followed by an 87-day uncontrolled oil spill into Gulf waters. BP released the estimate in part to ensure investors that it is prepared to handle the remaining costs. “Over the past few months we’ve made significant progress resolving outstanding Deepwater Horizon claims and today we can estimate all the material liabilities remaining from the incident,” Brian Gilvary, the company’s chief financial officer, said in the statement. “Importantly, we have a clear plan for managing these costs and it provides our investors with certainty going forward.” Any additional costs from the spill are not likely to affect the company’s financial performance, BP said.

The payments, which the company said in a statement it plans to make in 2016 and 2017, are meant to resolve accusations that BP downplayed the severity of the 87-day spill and the rate of oil being released from an undersea well, to the detriment of investors. BP had estimated publicly that 1,000 to 5,000 barrels were leaking from its Macondo well into the Gulf each day. But internal communications within the company, revealed years later, showed that officials really thought the spill rate was at least 10 times higher. A research group organized by the federal government put the number at 62,000 barrels per day. When the higher figures were revealed, BP’s stock prices fell. Shareholders had filed a lawsuit, seeking $2.5 billion, claiming that BP’s actions artificially inflated the value of its stock. A judge ruled that investors who bought stock between 2007 and 2010 are eligible to sue. A federal judge must approve the proposed settlement. BP is still facing other securities-related litigation related to the 2010 spill. View the discussion thread.

BP and other groups were still working on a response plan for the leak on Sunday, according to the report. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday morning.  The cause of the spill is unknown, officials reported. Employees on Friday morning discovered leaks at the oil and gas well in Arctic Alaska about five miles from the remote town of Deadhorse.  At the time, the well was spilling crude oil, but that plume did not leave the well pad, state regulators said. Officials haven’t been able to assess potential damage to the surrounding tundra or estimate how much oil was released from the well.  The site was also venting natural gas from two locations: a leak near the top of the well and another lower down. Officials triggered a safety valve that both shut down the leak at the top of the well and reduced emissions from the second leak site, but the well was still releasing natural gas as of Sunday afternoon.

640,2016-10-31,2016,10.0,31,Timothy Cama,GAO faults feds on key response to BP spill | TheHill,"The Interior Department isn’t doing sufficient work to track whether a key response to the 2010 BP oil spill is working, government auditors said. At issue are changes to improve hiring and retention for key staff supervising oil and natural gas drilling activities at the three agencies that oversee drilling on federal land and offshore: the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement and the Bureau of Land Management.  While Interior has taken steps to increase salaries and benefits and cut down on hiring time for the workers, “the department has not evaluated the effectiveness of this compensation in resolving its hiring and retention challenges,” the Government Accountability Office (GAO) wrote in a report released publicly Monday. Nonetheless, the department believes its changes have been helpful. “Officials from the three bureaus said that these efforts to increase the compensation paid to key oil and gas staff, along with the industry downturn that reduced private sector hiring, had likely helped them fill vacancies,” the GAO wrote. But auditors said that isn’t enough, and Interior should follow standard government practices for tracking the effectiveness of the changes. “In the absence of these evaluations, Interior cannot determine the extent to which the tools it is using are effective in meeting its goals of hiring and retaining key staff or whether it is expending funds on tools that are not the best use of its limited resources,” they wrote. Interior tried in recent years to improve hiring and retention, stemming in part from lessons learned from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the worst environmental disaster in United States history. The department’s main competition for these oil and gas employees is the industry itself, and officials believe it is important to keep salaries and other conditions that are competitive. Certain oil and gas staffers started getting special salary increases, incentives and student loan repayments in 2012, and over the last four years, Congress has allowed the agencies to pay some staffers as much as 25 percent more than they could usually get. But as the industry inevitably recovers from its historic downturn in the coming years, GAO said officials are worried it will again gain a hiring edge. Interior took issue with some parts of the GAO evaluation, particularly its characterization of the department’s current efforts. But it told GAO that it agreed with many of the report’s conclusions regarding the need to improve how it analyzes the programs at issue and how bureaus within the department coordinate efforts.

642,2018-04-20,2018,4.0,20,"Diane Hoskins, opinion contributor",Offshore drilling and exploration proposals prove no lessons learned after BP Deepwater Horizon | TheHill,"Eight years ago, in the largest environmental disaster in U.S. history, BP’s exploratory Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded. Millions of gallons of oil gushed into the Gulf of Mexico, and the world watched failed attempt after failed attempt to contain the blow-out. Eleven people died and it took 87 days to stop the spilling well. This resulted in a loss of 10 million user-days of beach visits, fishing and boating. Since then, safety standards have not been improved in any meaningful way. In fact, the Trump administration is working to roll back the handful of safeguards that were put in place as a result of the disaster.   The Gulf’s marine ecosystem continues to suffer even today. Years after the spill, whales and dolphins continued to die at higher rates and experienced diminished reproductive success. Heart-breaking images of oil-soaked birds and sick and dead sea turtles make clear that this is not a risk we should bring to any new areas. But that is exactly what is being proposed. If the Trump administration has its way, dangerous new oil and gas exploration could soon begin along the Atlantic coast. Few may realize that the BP Deepwater Horizon rig was tapping an exploration well when it exploded.  The distressing scenes from the Gulf disaster were only the most visible effects in a years-long series of assaults on the marine environment. Harmful exploration activities begin with seismic airgun blasting — ships towing miles-long arrays of seismic airguns and related equipment pummeling the ocean with very loud explosions of air that are used to search for potential oil deposits below the seafloor. The blasting is repeated every 10-12 seconds, 24 hours a day, for up to a year. Once the blasting starts, the damage begins. According to the government’s own estimates, marine mammals that use sound to communicate and navigate under water could be harassed or harmed hundreds of thousands of times if these activities go forward. Studies have also shown that seismic airgun blasting can kill zooplankton, damage shellfish larvae and alter fish behavior —potentially reducing catch rates of some species by 50 percent or more. That is why all three East Coast fishery management councils and numerous recreational and commercial fishing associations have voiced opposition to seismic airgun blasting.  And, seismic airgun blasting only identifies potential oil and gas deposits; exploratory wells like the BP Deepwater Horizon Macondo well are required to definitively confirm the presence of oil and its commercial viability. Between the disruptive and dangerous seismic airgun blasting and the potentially disastrous exploratory test wells — oil and gas exploration on its own is a grave threat to the thriving tourism, fishing and recreation economies that depend on a clean, healthy coastal ecosystem. If oil is found, even more drilling follows, and more exploration, followed by the industrialization of the coast as beach towns begin their transformation into oil towns.  Some have argued that “we should just see what’s out there,” but this sentiment is either misinformed or disingenuous. Seismic companies sell their proprietary information to oil companies for millions of dollars, and, under current law, they won’t have to share it with coastal state governments. The information remains private for 25 years. This doesn’t have to happen. Indeed, the Obama administration concluded that the “value of obtaining the geophysical and geological information from new airgun seismic surveys in the Atlantic does not outweigh the potential risks of those surveys’ acoustic pulse impacts on marine life.”  Over 200 municipalities; hundreds of local, state, and federal lawmakers; tens of thousands of small businesses and fishing families; and millions of citizens made sure that the Obama administration heard their voices, and ultimately, they succeeded. Based on this wave of opposition, as well as the scientific evidence of the risks involved, the previous administration removed the Atlantic from the five-year plan and denied permits for seismic airgun blasting and dangerous exploration.

If the administration approves dangerous exploration with seismic airguns, it is ignoring the people on the coast, ignoring the evidence that demonstrates the great harm this will cause to marine ecosystems and coastal economies, and is ignoring its mandate to responsibly protect and manage our nation’s natural resources. Eight years ago, we saw just how disastrous oil and gas exploration truly is. Trump and Zinke should reverse course on their dangerous exploration and offshore drilling plans.     Diane Hoskins is the campaign director at Oceana, an international ocean advocacy organization established in 2001 by The Pew Charitable Trusts, Oak Foundation, Marisla Foundation (formerly Homeland Foundation), and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.

Magallanes reportedly worked on congressional relations during her time with the agency and is the Interior Department’s second top official to leave in the last week. Her move comes almost a year after President Trump's controversial move to massively shrink two national monuments in Utah, which potentially opened up thousands of acres to drilling, mining and grazing.  The move to erase efforts to preserve the monuments by former Presidents Obama and Clinton represented the largest-ever rollback of protected areas, which prompted much criticism from lawmakers and activists.

Carbon emissions grew 2 percent over the last year, roughly 0.6 gigatonnes. ""That’s roughly equivalent to the carbon emissions associated with increasing the number of passenger cars on the planet by a third,"" BP chief economist Spencer Dale said in the report. Global energy consumption grew by 2.9 percent, largely driven by China, India and the U.S. Specifically in the U.S., consumption increased by 3.5 percent, the fastest growth seen for 30 years and in sharp contrast to the decline seen over the last 10 years. BP's report comes as urgency builds globally to contain temperature increases. “At a time when society is increasing its demands for an accelerated transition to a low carbon energy system, the energy data for 2018 paint a worrying picture, with both energy demand and carbon emissions growing at the fastest rates seen for years,” Dale said. Renewable power grew by 14.5 percent in 2018, which is slightly below its historical average, according to the review.

In an announcement Thursday, oil giant BP – which acquired the business, formerly known as Chargemaster, in 2018 – said it planned to install 400 ultra-fast chargers at BP locations by the end of 2021. BP Chargemaster says it operates the largest public charging network in the U.K., connecting more than 7,000 charging points. In June, the firm said it expected the 150 kW charger to provide roughly 100 miles of range in 10 minutes. ""BP's forecourts are ideal locations for this technology, which will provide an expected dwell time of 10-12 minutes, not dissimilar from the average of around seven minutes spent by drivers of petrol and diesel cars on a forecourt today,"" BP Chargemaster's chief operating officer, David Newton, said in a statement Thursday. As more people start to drive electric vehicles over longer distances, the need for a large-scale charging network will become increasingly pressing. Earlier this week, the U.K.'s Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, announced an extra £2.5 million ($3.03 million) of funding for charging points on residential streets. ""It's vital that electric vehicle drivers feel confident about the availability of chargepoints near their homes, and that charging an electric car is seen as easy as plugging in a smartphone,"" Shapps said Monday.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/15/bp-chargemaster-installs-ultra-fast-charging-points-for-cars-in-london.html,,CNBC
646,2019-05-02,2019,5.0,2,"Ben Lefebvre,David Siders,Marianne LeVine",Trump erases offshore drilling rules enacted after BP oil spill,"The Trump administration on Thursday dismantled safety rules for offshore drilling put in place by the Obama administration after the disastrous BP oil spill fouled the Gulf of Mexico nearly a decade ago. The rollbacks are a major victory for the oil and gas industry that has criticized the Obama rules as too onerous and costly to comply with, but which supporters say have helped prevent a repeat of the accident that killed 11 workers and spewed more than 200 million gallons of oil in 2010. “Incorporating the best available science, best practices and technological innovations of the past decade, the rule eliminates unnecessary regulatory burdens while maintaining safety and environmental protection offshore,"" Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said in a statement.  The final version of the changes to Well Control Rules come shortly after the Interior Department said it was pushing back plans to open up vast new areas of coastline for oil and gas exploration in federal waters, a move that would delay the controversial expansion until after the 2020 election.  That new rules are designed to ease drilling in places like the Gulf of Mexico, where oil production reached a record 1.9 million barrels a day at the end of last year, according to the Energy Information Administration. The new rule, which takes effect in 60 days from Friday, reduces the frequency of tests to key equipment such as blowout preventers, which sit at the wellhead at the ocean floor and are the last-ditch defense against massive gushers. It also allows drillers to use third-party companies instead of government inspectors to check equipment and gives them more time between inspections, among other things. The energy industry welcomed the new rule, and the National Ocean Industries Association President Randall Luthi said in statement the Obama rule ""while well intentioned, was flawed with technical problems that actually detracted from the goal of safe operations.” The revisions, he said, ""leave the original rule largely intact, further manage risks and better protect workers and the environment, making drilling safer.” Environmentalists say the rollback puts both the Gulf waters and workers' safety in jeopardy. “The well control rule was one of the most important actions we took, as a nation, in response to the BP-style disaster at sea,” Earthjustice, League of Conservation Voters, Natural Resources Defense Council and the Wilderness Society said in a joint statement. “If the Trump administration’s final rule weakens these protections, as its proposed changes did, it will put our workers, waters and wildlife at needless risk. That’s irresponsible, reckless and wrong.” The rollback is also opposed by Rep. Francis Rooney, a Florida Republican from a coastal district, who last year joined in a bipartisan letter with 20 other members of the state's congressional delegation calling on then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to reverse course. Interior's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement acknowledged in the final rule that “a large majority of the approximately 118,000 comments that BSEE received voiced significant concerns about the proposed changes.” But it defended the changes as a way to get rid of burdensome rules that it contends wouldn’t have made rigs any safer, even though it said at times that the changes were driven by industry’s worries about costs. In one example, BSEE said it was allowing companies to test blowout preventers less often because of industry complaints about the cost of such tests. “In recent years, the industry has raised concerns related to the benefits of pressure and function testing of subsea [blowout preventers] when compared to the costs and potential operational issues associated with such testing, including wear and tear,” the agency said in the rule.  Green groups are studying the rules and looking for flaws they can challenge with lawsuits, said Chris Eaton, an attorney for Earthjustice. He said that as with other Trump administration regulatory rollbacks that courts have blocked, the new Well Control Rule fails to show why loosening the Obama safeguards was necessary. “You’ve got this prior rule that was promulgated on factual findings — the original rule would reduce loss of control, make things safer, and it cited tons of studies,” Eaton said. “Then you have this rollback that just says we’ll get rid of that and be just as safe, but doesn’t look at the factual findings that went before that. It’s a change of position that doesn’t actually address the evidence.” Critics are also slamming Interior for a lack of transparency: The new rules reference standards written by the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association, that could only be read on the group's website. To download or print the standards, members of the public must register with the trade association on its website and pay a fee. “To add insult to injury, in order to know what the final rule entails, the public is again being forced to be beholden to the regulated industry,” said Danielle Brian, executive director of the group Project On Government Oversight. “If this isn't the perfect example of a government agency being captured by the industry it regulates, I don't know what is."" An API spokesperson denied the allegation, and said the group had met accessibility requirements set by the Office of Management and Budget — and that it goes beyond those rules by keeping the standards accessible beyond the public comment period.",https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/02/offshore-drilling-rules-1404098,,Politico

ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods might meet Putin in Moscow on Wednesday on the sidelines of the conference, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Woods and BP boss Robert Dudley are listed among the panelists of this week’s conference, which is also expected to be attended by officials from Iran, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. Peskov said that Putin and Woods, if their meeting happens, would discuss ‘potential cooperation areas’ in a ‘short meeting’. BP declined to comment on Dudley’s plans. Western oil executives frequently visited Russia before relations with Moscow soured in 2014 following the annexation of Crimea by Russia and subsequent insurgency in eastern Ukraine. This was followed by allegations of Moscow meddling in the 2016 U.S. elections, which the Kremlin has denied, and wider sanctions against Russian individuals and corporates. As the result of the sanctions, ExxonMobil had to withdraw from joint energy projects with Kremlin-controlled Rosneft in the Arctic. Woods attended a Russian conference in St. Petersburg in 2017, while Dudley, former head of Anglo-Russian oil producer TNK-BP, which was sold to Rosneft in 2013, met Putin in March in the Kremlin at a gathering with UK businesses.

650,2019-10-04,2019,10.0,4,"Ron Bousso, Dmitry Zhdannikov",Dudley's decade at the helm of BP almost didn't happen,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley’s decade at the helm of one of the world’s biggest oil companies almost didn’t happen. Dropped into the role in 2010 after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster, 11 rig workers had just died and the company’s finances were teetering. Dudley had lived in Mississippi in his youth and spent his holidays fishing on the Gulf. He was now put in charge of cleaning up the biggest environmental disaster in U.S. history in those very waters. As BP scrambled to contain a crisis that threatened to take down a company after more than 100 years of operation, investors were running scared. Its market valued halved in two months as the scale of the disaster unfolded. Dudley received an early morning phone call that marked what would be the “worst moment”, he told Reuters in an interview last year. “When I heard that our debt was untradable back in the summer of 2010... To me that was a moment of the unthinkable was possible.” The feared collapse of BP did not come, but the onslaught did, with BP facing clean-up costs and lawsuits that would eventually top a staggering $75 billion. Dudley needed to sell oil and gas assets to find the money and so the sell-off began, with BP eventually doing deals worth over $60 billion, including selling prized assets such as its Texas City refinery, Gulf of Mexico oilfields and Russian joint venture. He shrank BP, but the drastic diet left Dudley in charge of a company fitter than some of rivals when the next challenge hit in the form of 2014’s collapse in oil prices. The slide would roll into early 2016, with Brent crude oil LCOc1 prices falling more than 70% to levels not seen since 2003 and companies reeling to cut costs. Born in New York, Dudley grew up in Mississippi and later moved to Illinois where he attended university. He entered the oil world in 1979 when joining U.S. firm Amoco, where he held a number of roles including working in Russia before BP took over the company in 1998 and retained his services. His Russian experience helped Dudley win the top job at BP’s Russian joint venture TNK-BP venture in 2003. Five years later Dudley made global headlines as he fled Russia fearing for his life after falling out with Russian oligarchs who accused Dudley of favoritism towards BP employees. Dudley in turn accused the oligarchs of using the Kremlin and other Russian authorities to help settle purely commercial disputes. Despite the clash, Dudley’s composed managerial style would again shine through as he later became one of the Kremlin’s closest Western business allies. BP and the oligarchs would later sell TNK-BP to Russian oil producer Rosneft for over $50 billion. A quarter of BP’s oil production now originates from Russia. In March, Dudley helped organize a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and top UK businesses in a bid to smooth relations damaged by the poisoning in Britain of former double agent Sergei Skripal, for which Britain blames Russia. “He has led BP in a very wise, calm way over the last decade,” BP Chairman Helge Lund told Reuters in an interview in June. Dudley oversaw not only BP’s recovery from near collapse in 2010 but its rebound from the 2014 oil crisis. But he leaves with one major unfinished task, namely, BP’s transition to greener energy and lower emissions. Although BP has agreed to set targets to reduce some of its carbon emissions and increase spending on renewables, critics say under Dudley BP has done too little to reduce carbon emissions and increase investment in renewable energy. Instead, it has posted its fastest expansion in oil and gas production in decades, rising some 20% since 2016. “From the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster to the climate emergency, Bob Dudley’s tenure as BP’s boss has been a failure,” said John Sauven, executive director at Greenpeace UK. “These valuable years should have been used to end the expansion of fossil fuels.” Shareholders have also expressed criticism, rejecting his pay package in 2016 and forcing BP to cut it by 40%. Dudley, who turns 65 next September, will step down in February to make way for successor Bernard Looney, BP’s current head of upstream operations.

651,2019-10-04,2019,10.0,4,Ron Bousso,BP to make Bernard Looney CEO as climate challenge looms,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bernard Looney, who will replace Bob Dudley as chief executive of BP when he retires next year, faces the tricky task of navigating the energy major through a rising tide of environmentalism and the move to a low-carbon economy. BP (BP.L) on Friday appointed Looney, head of upstream, to succeed Dudley, who led the oil and gas company back to growth from near collapse in 2010. As CEO, Looney will be charged with continuing to adapt BP to the transition to lower-carbon energy as pressure from investors grows to meet targets under the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. Looney, 49, took charge of BP’s oil and gas production, or upstream operations, in 2016 as the sector grappled with the aftermath of the 2014 collapse in oil prices. The Irishman’s energetic management style was quickly felt as he spearheaded BP’s drive to improve performance through cost cutting and digitalization. He has led BP through some of its fastest growth in oil and gas production, as output has risen by around 20% since 2016 with the launch of more than 20 major projects around the world and the acquisition of BHP’s U.S. shale assets this year for $10.5 billion - BP’s biggest deal in three decades. “Bernard is a terrific choice to lead the company next,” Dudley, who turned 64 last month, said in a statement. “He knows BP and our industry as well as anyone but is creative and not bound by traditional ways of working. I have no doubt that he will thoughtfully lead BP through the transition to a low-carbon future.” BP shares were up 1.1% by 1030 GMT in London, compared with a 0.74% gain for rival Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L). (GRAPHIC - BP profits: here) BP took a number of steps in recent years around climate such as setting partial carbon emissions-reduction targets and investing in renewable energy. But many investors and activists say the 110-year-old firm needs to do more. Dudley, who took the helm months after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the largest oil spill in U.S. history that left 11 rig workers dead, has resisted setting wider climate targets, often quoting the fear of litigation. As Looney takes over, climate is bound to be central. “Given the drive for digital solutions and the work on reducing carbon emissions it is likely that the appointment of Mr Looney as CEO may accelerate the journey that BP is on regarding the energy transition,” Barclays analyst Lydia Rainforth said in a note. NEAR-BUST TO BOOM Dudley will step down as CEO after the company’s full-year results on Feb. 4, 2020 and will retire on March 31, BP said. Dudley, who succeeded Tony Hayward, led the company through near-bankruptcy after the spill and through an oil price crash four years later. Preparations for Dudley’s departure were accelerated after Helge Lund became BP chairman in January with a mandate to oversee succession plans. Dudley has had to navigate a vast asset disposal to pay for more than $60 billion in litigation and clean-up costs followed by a landmark settlement with U.S. authorities. Dudley has had overwhelming support from investors at BP’s annual general meetings, however a majority of shareholders opposed his 2016 pay package, forcing the company to slash it by 40%.

653,2019-09-30,2019,9.0,30,George Hay,Breakingviews - Bob Dudley has made decent lemonade from BP lemons,"LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - BP handed Bob Dudley lemons, and he has fashioned passable lemonade. The chief executive of the $130 billion UK oil major is drawing up plans to step down next year, Reuters reported on Monday. His legacy will be sweeter than the one he inherited nine years ago. BP shares have recorded a 56% total return including dividends since Dudley took over in October 2010. That is lower than Royal Dutch Shell’s 70% but slightly higher than Exxon Mobil’s 55%. The company is producing 3.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day now, not too far below the 4 million cited in its 2009 annual report. And Dudley last year managed an 11.2% return on average capital employed, better than 2009’s 11%. That’s not bad given his first job on taking over – and for years after - was to sort out the mess created by BP’s oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010. As of end 2018, the cumulative hit to BP’s pre-tax profit from the cleanup was $67 billion. Dudley has not only managed to pay this while maintaining BP’s reserves, but also had the headroom last year to spend $10.5 billion buying BHP’s U.S. shale assets. It helped that BP’s lemonade was accompanied by big helpings of humble pie. Given overall output fell to almost 3 million boe per day by 2014, Dudley was an early and involuntary champion of shareholder value over production volume and had to adopt a no-sacred-cows approach to disposals. His peers ended up following suit after global oil prices collapsed in 2014. By getting out of longstanding operations in Alaska and buying shale assets with short production cycles in the U.S. Permian region, BP’s payback period - the time it takes to cover project investment costs - is shorter than for Shell and Total, according to Citi research. Granted, the BP boss has - unlike his rival at Shell - held back from incorporating emissions created by the users of his products into those the company thinks it should cut. That is hardly a very green stance. But no one yet knows when the energy transition will bite, and the company’s shorter-duration projects mean it should be easier to switch to greener activities more quickly if need be. Like Dudley’s BP tenure in general, that’s a decent base on which a successor can build. Reuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

BP’s first American CEO has indicated several times in closed discussions in recent years that he would like to retire at the age of 65, taking him into 2020. His retirement plans were discussed at BP’s board meeting in the United States last week, but no final date has been decided, according to the sources. A BP spokesman declined to comment. Sky News reported on Saturday that Dudley plans to step down within a year and that an announcement could be made by the end of 2019. Preparations for his departure were accelerated after Helge Lund became BP chairman in January 2019 with a mandate to oversee succession plans. There has still been no decision on a successor, the sources said. Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary and Bernard Looney, head of oil and gas production, are seen as leading candidates, sources have previously told Reuters. Dudley became CEO after his predecessor Tony Hayward stepped down in the wake of the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico that left 11 rig workers dead and led to the largest oil spill in U.S. history.  He has since had to navigate near bankruptcy, a vast asset disposal to pay for over $60 billion in litigation and clean-up costs followed by a landmark settlement with U.S. authorities.

658,2019-10-04,2019,10.0,4,"Ron Bousso, Dmitry Zhdannikov",NEWSMAKER-Dudley's decade at the helm of BP almost didn't happen,"LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley’s decade at the helm of one of the world’s biggest oil companies almost didn’t happen. Dropped into the role in 2010 after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster, 11 rig workers had just died and the company’s finances were teetering. Dudley had lived in Mississippi in his youth and spent his holidays fishing on the Gulf. He was now put in charge of cleaning up the biggest environmental disaster in U.S. history in those very waters. As BP scrambled to contain a crisis that threatened to take down a company after more than 100 years of operation, investors were running scared. Its market valued halved in two months as the scale of the disaster unfolded. Dudley received an early morning phone call that marked what would be the “worst moment”, he told Reuters in an interview last year. “When I heard that our debt was untradable back in the summer of 2010... To me that was a moment of the unthinkable was possible.” The feared collapse of BP did not come, but the onslaught did, with BP facing clean-up costs and lawsuits that would eventually top a staggering $75 billion. Dudley needed to sell oil and gas assets to find the money and so the sell-off began, with BP eventually doing deals worth over $60 billion, including selling prized assets such as its Texas City refinery, Gulf of Mexico oilfields and Russian joint venture. He shrank BP, but the drastic diet left Dudley in charge of a company fitter than some of rivals when the next challenge hit in the form of 2014’s collapse in oil prices. The slide would roll into early 2016, with Brent crude oil prices falling more than 70% to levels not seen since 2003 and companies reeling to cut costs. Born in New York, Dudley grew up in Mississippi and later moved to Illinois where he attended university. He entered the oil world in 1979 when joining U.S. firm Amoco, where he held a number of roles including working in Russia before BP took over the company in 1998 and retained his services. His Russian experience helped Dudley win the top job at BP’s Russian joint venture TNK-BP venture in 2003. Five years later Dudley made global headlines as he fled Russia fearing for his life after falling out with Russian oligarchs who accused Dudley of favouritism towards BP employees. Dudley in turn accused the oligarchs of using the Kremlin and other Russian authorities to help settle purely commercial disputes. Despite the clash, Dudley’s composed managerial style would again shine through as he later became one of the Kremlin’s closest Western business allies. BP and the oligarchs would later sell TNK-BP to Russian oil producer Rosneft for over $50 billion. A quarter of BP’s oil production now originates from Russia. In March, Dudley helped organise a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and top UK businesses in a bid to smooth relations damaged by the poisoning in Britain of former double agent Sergei Skripal, for which Britain blames Russia. “He has led BP in a very wise, calm way over the last decade,” BP Chairman Helge Lund told Reuters in an interview in June.

669,2017-10-20 00:00:00,2017,10.0,20,Zahra Hirji,"A String Of Dangerous Accidents In Alaska Sends BP Reeling, Emails Show","At least 27 accidents happened at BP’s oil and gas operations in Alaska this year, including five that risked the lives of dozens of workers, BuzzFeed News has learned. Now BP’s top officials are scrambling to “reset” the company’s safety culture before one of these scares turns into a human or environmental catastrophe on the Alaskan North Slope, according to internal emails, recordings, interviews, and other documentation obtained by BuzzFeed News. On Sept. 10, for example, two workers responding to faulty equipment inside a building at a drill site inadvertently triggered a leak of 1,200 kilograms of gas, one of several serious accidents that have not been publicly reported before now. Fortunately, the two employees escaped uninjured. But it had the potential to be a deadly explosion. “If there had been an ignition source, we might have lost colleagues,” BP Alaska President Janet Weiss wrote in an email to Team Alaska, the workforce in the state, on Sept. 12. “We must change now; we must have a reset,” Weiss added. She sent another urgent plea to staff two weeks later. “Our safety performance — both process and personal — is not where it should be and no other business objective is more important,” Weiss wrote in an email to Alaska staff on Sept. 27. The company was concerned enough to take the drastic step of removing many workers from Prudhoe Bay, the largest oil and gas field in the state, for the first 12 days of October. This break, and the preceding accidents, likely cut into BP’s bottom line, which in Alaska hit $85 million in 2016. During the recent pause, staff took part in large workshops and smaller team-level discussions focused on improving safety. “The safety of our workers and protection of the environment are BP’s top priorities,” a BP spokesperson told BuzzFeed News by email. “In Alaska, one of the ways in which we work to fulfill our commitment to safe, compliant and reliable operations is a program for pipeline assurance that includes nearly 300,000 inspections each year,” the spokesperson added. “In addition, this month, while continuing daily operations, we instituted a safety timeout when we held workshops and other trainings to continue to educate workers and promote personal and process safety.” All of this unequivocally shows that BP Alaska officials know there’s a safety problem and are desperately trying to clean it up. Their proposed fixes center on reinforcing company procedures and asking people to be more vigilant, according to three longtime senior BP operations employees. But some say this approach doesn’t get at the heart of the problem: the company cutting corners. “BP management recognizes the many recent critical incidents we’ve experienced will lead to a death,” a longtime employee told BuzzFeed News. “We are making the same mistakes we made 40 years ago.” Since the company started drilling in Prudhoe Bay in 1968, its operations in Alaska and elsewhere have resulted in a series of devastating accidents. Explosions at a Texas City refinery in 2005 killed 15 people and injured 180 more. Following a 2006 oil spill in Prudhoe Bay, the company had to pay millions in fees. And in April 2010, BP caused the largest oil spill in US history. That’s when the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform exploded about 40 miles off the coast of Louisiana, killing 11 workers, injuring at least 16 others, and releasing more than 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Marine animal populations are still struggling to recover, as are coastal wetlands, beaches, and other habitats polluted by the spill. The company has estimated the pretax cost of the spill is about $61.6 billion. Industry experts say that if a Deepwater Horizon–scale accident struck again, BP would face yet another PR nightmare, plus high fines and legal fees. “I find it impossible to think they could survive that,” Rick Steiner, an Alaska-based environmental consultant who helped respond to the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, told BuzzFeed News. This risk is reflected in how senior employees refer to the mistakes and accidents piling up in Alaska. “With BP these are called ‘company killers’ because there is an understanding that the company could not survive yet another Deepwater Horizon,” an oil industry source knowledgeable about BP’s Alaska operations told BuzzFeed News by email. BP's Prudhoe Bay Operations Center By Sept. 12, BP Alaska had experienced at least 27 incidents in 2017, compared to 23 in all of 2016, according to one of Weiss’s emails. And this year has already seen more events resulting in toxic spills and leaks — called A-G LOPC events, for “loss of primary containment.” Five of these toxic releases were classified as risky “Tier 1 events.” In BP’s 2016 US Economic Impact Report, these events were described as “the most consequential events involving an unplanned or uncontrolled release of materials.” The 2006 oil spill in Prudhoe Bay, for example, was Tier 1. “I’m deeply concerned that with these trends, we are not in a stable state,” Weiss wrote in the Sept. 12 email. Weiss later shared a PowerPoint slide listing the five Tier 1 episodes. The first, on March 19, involved about 37 gallons of crude oil spilling inside one company building. Two weeks later, on March 30, a 352-gallon outdoor oil spill happened at a different location. The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation confirmed to BuzzFeed News that BP Alaska did report the March 30 event. Officials said the earlier, smaller spill did not require reporting. On April 14, as reported in several media outlets, workers discovered a major gas leak several miles outside of the Alaskan town of Deadhorse. BP alerted officials. The response team — involving company workers, outside consultants, local officials, and federal regulators at the Environmental Protection Agency — took about three days to “kill” the well and halt its two leaks. About 45,000 kilograms of gas was released into the atmosphere and 63 gallons of crude oil spilled, according to the company’s preliminary investigation, filed to the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (AOGCC) on June 27. The report contends that human or company error was not to blame. “The investigation team found human factors to be neither causal nor contributory to this event,” the report says. “The investigation team found no evidence of a systematic failure (leadership, culture, etc.).” Instead, the report claims that the well failure was caused by melting permafrost. The company has since shut down 14 other wells in similarly dangerous conditions and identified others to review. These conclusions seem to contradict the internal communications obtained by BuzzFeed News, however, which blame workers and BP’s safety culture for all five Tier 1 events. And employees, meanwhile, say the real problem is company leadership not supporting necessary trainings or maintaining facilities — similar to problems highlighted in the investigation following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill. As first reported by Alaska media and confirmed by BuzzFeed News, Alaska officials have mostly left the investigation of the April event to the company, and have no plans to issue fines or penalties. The company is expected to deliver a final report about this incident to the AOGCC by the end of October. In June, just days before turning over this report to regulators, BP suffered its fourth Tier 1 event. It was another leak, of 5,500 kilograms of gas inside a company building. The fifth event, in early September, was the gas leak that endangered two workers, triggering a month of soul-searching at the company. BP told BuzzFeed News it reported natural gas leaks to environmental officials in accordance with state and federal laws. “While the goal is to have no releases, both of these incidents occurred during planned maintenance and were halted quickly, and neither resulted in injury to workers or impact to the surrounding environment,” according to the company spokesperson. Gas flares stand outside BP's Central Gas Facility in Prudhoe Bay. In the Sept. 12 email announcing an internal investigation into the accident, Weiss asked team leaders to be visible on worksites — “to ensure Safety is treated as the #1 priority” — and requested all staff to “Follow the rules, Finish What we Start and Follow-up.” On Sept. 27, she announced a three-day stoppage of certain work in the North Slope and in town starting Oct. 1. This work pause was later extended to Oct. 12. During this break, the company continued to produce oil and gas, but many workers were pulled out of the field and other operations to focus on safety. “It’s a dramatic step to take,” said oil and gas consultant Ken Arnold, who worked at Shell Oil Company for 16 years. “It’s rare that it needs to be done and it’s very good it is done.” Left: September 12th email; Right: September 27th email (Click or tap to enlarge) Later on the 27th, Weiss sent a more general email about safety. “To be clear, we will no longer tolerate work that is not planned and we will take disciplinary action for such rule violations — the safety of our colleagues is at stake,” she wrote. She provided three examples of how staff could contribute to discipline on the job, called “Operating Discipline,” and asked staff to watch a video of a fatal decision. September 27th email The next day, dozens of BP Alaska workers gathered for a meeting, where they heard from company executives. “Learning is a verb, right? It’s an action word. [If] you don’t take action, you're not really learning, right?” Jeff Kilfoyle, health and safety manager at BP’s Exploration Alaska, told the room, according to a recording obtained by BuzzFeed News. “What we found is that within our business, we tend to communicate a lot, we tend to share a lot, but it doesn’t necessarily result in real learning and something changing in our organization. Consequently, we see repeat events, right?” Jeff Kilfoyle on Sept. 28 On Sept. 30, Kilfoyle and others spoke at yet another meeting of BP Alaska workers. “Obviously, any gas release is not a good thing,” Kilfoyle said, according to a recording obtained by BuzzFeed News. “But a gas release of that magnitude inside a structure with people is obviously a major concern to us within Alaska and within the business, right — that’s not a place we want to be.” Jeff Kilfoyle on Sept. 30 “We’re just altogether too comfortable with handling and being around gas, and I think we need to get more uncomfortable,” added Anchala Klein, a vice president at BP’s Global Wells Organization. Anchala Klein on Sept. 30 Klein also mentioned how she had recently watched a video of the July 1988 disaster when Piper Alpha, a North Sea oil platform operated by Occidental Petroleum Limited, blew up and killed 167 workers. She encouraged everyone else to see it too. More than halfway through the work stoppage, Weiss addressed employees again. This time her tone was optimistic. “I received very encouraging feedback from many of you on the positive difference the reset is having across our Alaska business,” she wrote to staff on Oct. 9. “With Prudhoe’s 40th anniversary this year, we have taken on the challenge of creating another 40 years for Greater Prudhoe Bay. To do this we must move forward, respecting one another and knowing that a safe and in control businesses is an efficient business.” ● This story has been updated with comments from the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation.

670,2018-09-28 00:00:00,2018,9.0,28,Nathaniel Janowitz,Revealed: Documents Show BP Quietly Paid Just $25 Million to Mexico After The Worst Oil Spill Of The Century,"TONALÁ, Mexico — The Mexican government quietly accepted a $25.5 million payout earlier this year from oil giant BP to free the company of responsibility for polluting Mexican waters after the largest oil spill of the 21st century. The tiny payout was part of a confidential settlement to dismiss a lawsuit relating to the Deepwater Horizon disaster, when a BP offshore drilling rig exploded on April 20, 2010, in the Gulf of Mexico. It killed 11 workers and released more than 4 million barrels of oil off the coast of Louisiana — roughly 200 miles from Mexican territory. BP and the US government immediately set about addressing the pollution in US waters, but the extent of the damage to Mexican waters is still publicly unknown. BP spent at least $60 billion in total related to the 2010 spill, more than $10 billion of which went to affected US fishermen and businesses. Not a single peso has gone to an affected Mexican. Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico on April 21, 2010. Dozens of previously unseen court documents, minutes from government meetings, and academic papers obtained by BuzzFeed News raise deep questions about both the Mexican government’s and BP’s actions in the case. The Mexican government was slow to react to the spill, waiting until the last minute before filing a lawsuit against BP, before voluntarily dropping it less than five years later in a $25.5 million settlement. At the same time, the Mexican government, under outgoing president Enrique Peña Nieto, made several multimillion-dollar deals with BP. Meanwhile, the Mexican government appears to have ignored evidence that could have been used to bolster its case against BP. Reports by a number of scientific institutions were classified by the government, keeping the extent of the damage from the public, including more than 10,000 fishermen who sued the oil giant for compensation in a separate lawsuit. A two-year-long investigation by BuzzFeed News and the corporate transparency initiative PODER can reveal for the first time that: The Mexican government quietly settled a five-year-long lawsuit against BP in return for a $25.5 million payment; over $15 million has already been paid even though they’ve never made a public announcement about the dismissal of the lawsuit or payment. This agreement released BP from responsibility for any damages caused by the spill in Mexican waters. Mexico said it could find no evidence of pollution caused by BP — potentially ignoring research submitted at least twice by some of Mexico’s most respected scientists. The government spent millions funding 22 scientific studies that it did not introduce as evidence in its lawsuit. It also withheld them from the public. The Mexican government simultaneously handed numerous lucrative energy contracts to BP, including five oil-drilling sites, two natural gas pipeline contracts, and a plan to build 1,500 BP-branded gas stations. These findings were discovered after years of information requests through Mexico’s transparency agency, which were initially met with resistance. The agency regularly returned blacked-out documents and ignored questions, claiming the Mexican federal lawsuit in the US against BP barred it from releasing information. Many of the answers it did give were vague, and some were flat-out wrong. In interviews with BuzzFeed News, leading scientists raised their concerns about the government's and BP’s responses to the disaster and its immediate aftermath in Mexican waters. Scientists complained that the limited research trips they carried out were underfunded by the Mexican government compared to the US’s. Several of these studies were then shut down by the government around the same time that Peña Nieto launched his energy reform, in 2014. Mexico's outgoing president, Enrique Peña Nieto. The revelations about BP and Peña Nieto’s administration come months after Andrés Manuel López Obrador won a landslide victory in a presidential election held on July 1, riding a wave of anger at the corruption among Mexico’s ruling class. López Obrador fashioned himself as the people’s champion, and one of his main campaign talking points was Peña Nieto’s cozying up to the oil industry. Three days before the election, the Mexican government celebrated BP, bestowing the country’s highest honor possible for foreigners to a man named Chris Sladen, who had recently retired after more than 10 years as head of the company’s Mexico operation. The Order of the Aztec Eagle is given by Mexico’s foreign affairs ministry, at the behest of a council established by the president. Under Sladen’s watch, BP made huge investments over the past few years in the most revolutionary policy change of Peña Nieto’s presidency, his 2014 energy reform program that opened up the sector to foreign investment and ended the near-eight-decade monopoly on oil exploration and production long held by Mexico’s state-owned oil company, Pemex. The foreign ministry tweeted a photo of Sladen being presented with the Order of the Aztec Eagle, flanked by Mexico’s foreign and energy ministers and the boss of Pemex, thanking him for “being an ally to our country and our energy industry.” Left: Evelio Jiménez. Right: Tar sits on the beach in Tonalá. On an overcast, humid day in mid-June, Evelio Jiménez wandered along the beach and through the dusty Gulf Coast town of Tonalá, pointing out an aunt’s house here or a cousin’s boat there. Generations of his family have fished these shores — the Tonalá River cuts a line between the states of Veracruz and Tabasco. The town marks a dreary spot at what’s known locally as La Bocana, the mouth, where the river meets the sea. There isn’t much fishing done these days. Boats sit unused, and Jiménez rarely goes out to sea now. The motor for his own boat, the Josefa, is back at his house, said Jiménez, a grandfather of eight and counting. “I don’t have a reason to go pay for the gas; it’s lost money.” Jiménez and several of his family members are a few of the thousands of fishermen along the six Mexican Gulf Coast states who have claimed in a lawsuit that the BP oil spill destroyed their way of life. These fishermen came together to bring their own cases against BP because they had no faith in their own government to protect their livelihoods. Over a two-year period, two dozen people from the fishing industry in six affected communities reiterated to BuzzFeed News the claims made in the lawsuit: “The Deepwater Horizon Incident has directly and severely impacted the Subsistence Plaintiffs in both the United States and Mexico by polluting their lands and fisheries and damaging the ecosystem vital to their culture and their survival.” Jiménez remembered the days in the immediate aftermath of the explosion, as they watched the news from the other side of the Gulf, thinking that it all seemed so far away. “It was all over the TV, the newspapers, the radio,” he said. “That it would get to us? We never had the idea. But then, that’s when the bad time began here.” In the weeks that followed, Jiménez began smelling oil in the air, followed soon after by visible streaks in the water that he said reached the town’s coastline. He pulled out four photos taken in the aftermath of the Deepwater disaster on the once picturesque Tonála beach, which showed remnants of the spill, known as oil mats or tarballs. He listed several fish species that he said were down in the region, and on the days he did fish, he said he had to go out much further and for longer trips, and still came home with less than before, “because there are no fish. There are species that almost no longer exist.” Backing up Jiménez’s claim is nearly impossible using the publicly available information from the Mexican government. Their statistics show drops in the catch on the Gulf Coast in a number of species around 2010, but they are not linear and conclusive, and the government has not published a study analyzing the issue. The few studies released by the Mexican government have been inconclusive about the damage caused by the spill. Discovering if BP damaged Mexican waters involves looking at the government’s response, and what it may have found — and never released. If it took Jiménez time to realize the gravity of the issue, the same could be said for the Mexican government — even as experts were warning that they needed to act. The currents of the Gulf of Mexico move in a variety of motions regardless of invisible borders in the water, including a direct southern pull from along the coast of Louisiana to Mexican waters beginning in the northeastern state of Tamaulipas. “It was a rather delayed response” by the Mexican government, said Luis Soto, an investigator at the Institute of Ocean and Limnology Sciences at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), one of the country’s top universities. “We as oceanographers were concerned, we knew the circulation of currents in the Gulf of Mexico … that sooner or later, we would have problems in our waters.” In the months following the spill, Soto and other scientists tried to convince the government of then-president Felipe Calderón that they needed to study the Gulf immediately. Prior to the Deepwater Horizon explosion, Mexico hadn’t monitored the body of water regularly, and they didn’t have preestablished “baseline data” — the normal conditions of the water. Without that data, the researchers would not be able to use the common scientific technique of hydrocarbon fingerprinting to test oil pollution in Mexican waters, and to try to match the hydrocarbons with those from the Deepwater Horizon spill in Mexican waters. The search for this “fingerprint” was to become a source of conflict between the Mexican government and leading oceanographers. There’s no debate in the US about the Deepwater Horizon fingerprint — or that BP was guilty. Unlike in Mexico, the US government quickly sprang into action after the explosion. By the end of May 2010, a little over a month after the explosion, then-president Barack Obama had created an independent commission to investigate the causes of the oil spill. Within eight months the commission determined that the explosion and spill were the consequences of a series of mistakes and omissions made by BP, and the companies it contracted, Halliburton and Transocean, calling it a “human, economic, and environmental disaster.” Crude oil that leaked from the Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico, on April 28, 2010, near New Orleans. Less than two weeks later, BP began running commercials in which its CEO at the time, Tony Hayward, called the spill “a tragedy that never should have happened,” before solemnly looking into the camera. “To those affected and your families, I am deeply sorry.” The US commission found that employees on the Deepwater Horizon rig ignored early warning signs, and missed opportunities to prevent the explosion that would lead to the largest oil spill of the 21st century. US researchers received billions in funding from both BP and the government, and proved that nearly the entire US Gulf Coast was affected, from Florida to Texas. They tracked large oil plumes in the water, traced the fingerprint to damaged corals on the sea bottom, and saw decreases in numerous fish and animal populations. A federal panel transferred all cases related to the spill to a Louisiana courthouse because of their experience with complex cases, like Hurricane Katrina. BP eventually pleaded guilty, and lawsuits against the company piled up from affected Americans. Attempts to reach Chris Sladen, and to organize interviews with representatives from BP USA and BP Mexico, were declined or ignored. BP USA noted in a reply by email “that all available evidence confirms that oil from the Deepwater Horizon incident did not reach Mexican waters or shorelines,” attaching a report by a US scientist. The Mexican government initially agreed to finance studies beginning in July 2010, by various academic and state-funded institutions coordinated by Mexico’s National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change (INECC). Soto’s team launched first on what was planned to be a five-year study of the Gulf. But Soto repeatedly stressed to BuzzFeed News how his team was underfunded and their equipment was subpar compared to their US neighbors. Mexico, he said, only had one boat capable of the expeditions that had to be undertaken, and it had to be shared by numerous institutions involved in the studies funded by the Mexican government. In contrast, 6,500 vessels were used to measure the damage to US waters at the height of the research response in 2010, according to BP. More than two years after the Deepwater explosion, on Dec. 1, 2012, Peña Nieto took office. He had run on a platform of change, with ambitious plans to reform the country’s energy industry, opening it up to foreign investors. The following spring, on April 19, 2013, for reasons that still remain unknown, the Mexican government finally decided to file a lawsuit against BP, accusing them of damaging Mexican waters. But shortly after, Soto’s investigation into the effects from the spill was ended by the government. Once Soto’s third expedition ended that year, he said the remainder of his studies were canceled. “Suddenly we were informed by the federal government that there was no longer monetary support for our campaign,” Soto said. “They said very clearly, ‘our priorities changed.’” The Mexican government funded 22 studies related to the BP spill between 2010 and 2014. Official documents for 19 of the studies reveal that they cost nearly $4 million, although the INECC did not provide figures for the other three studies and the final total is unknown. By contrast, in the US, a single research working group created by BP conducted more than 240 studies to the tune of $1.3 billion in less than five years after the spill. That doesn’t include the numerous other institutions and groups studying the US waters. The INECC told BuzzFeed News it didn’t cancel the studies, but rather used up the available budget. The INECC described the budget as “adequate” but confirmed there was a lack of resources, specifically referencing the single boat capable of carrying out the studies. It also said that, while it was easy to study the effects of the Deepwater spill in US waters, because of their proximity, it was much harder to establish the impact on Mexican waters. The INECC added, however, “it is the responsibility of the Mexican government to complete the monitoring to determine any potential damage, given that it is an interconnected ecosystem. This type of event can have long-term effects.” Nineteen of the 22 studies had been approved before Mexico filed its lawsuit against BP. No further studies related to the spill were approved after Peña Nieto launched his landmark energy reform in August 2014, raising questions about the government’s desire to get to the bottom of what happened. Soto repeatedly lambasted the government for the inadequate support he received, his funding being cut before he could finish, and how he was never able to coordinate with other institutions’ scientists who studied the aftermath of the spill to see how their research compared. Soto said he was contacted early on by Mexican lawyers working on the lawsuit against BP, and offered to be “helpful,” but never heard from them again. He remains convinced the region needs further study and that BP is most likely responsible for the damage to Mexican waters. “We’re neighbors, and your house is on fire. And we’re very close neighbors, and you’re saying nothing happened to you?” he asked rhetorically. “I mean, it’s ridiculous.” Anel Jiménez, Evelio Jiménez's youngest daughter, in Tonalá. BP, one of the world’s largest oil companies, undertook a major rebranding in 2000 in a bid to create an eco-friendly image. It spent more than $150 million on its new logo, adopting a sunflower, named “Helios” after the Greek sun god. A transnational energy conglomerate with a presence in 72 countries, BP conducts around a third of its business in the US — by far its largest market. The sunflower first became associated with a US disaster in 2005 when an explosion at BP’s Texas City refinery in 2005 killed 15 workers and injured 170 more. BP paid more than $1.5 billion related to the explosion in compensation. Less than a year later, a corroded BP pipeline in Alaska leaked hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil; the affected state received $225 million from BP and its partners in the project. The Texas City and Alaska payments hadn’t been fully paid out when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded. Images of oil-covered dolphins and pelicans went around the world, and yet again BP found itself at the center of an environmental disaster. Although the spill has faded from the public consciousness in the years since, lawsuit after lawsuit has passed through the Louisiana court, and billions have been paid to US interests. It could not be more different in Mexico. A number of Mexican Gulf states independently filed separate lawsuits in 2011, but the federal government waited two years and 364 days to sue BP — the last day possible to do so. When they did submit their suit to the US court on April 19, 2013, they made damning allegations, stating that “the spill remains in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico endangering the adjoining shorelines of Mexico. ... [T]he Gulf of Mexico is affected by deep currents that run from east to west in a circular pattern and which currents have transported a submerged plume of oil, dispersants and breakdown chemicals into the waters of Mexico.” Just a month later, in May 2013, the Louisiana court consolidated the Mexican lawsuit into a multi-district litigation, bundling it with hundreds of other new cases. The court then suspended the federal government lawsuit until further notice. Several months later the court dismissed the separate lawsuit brought by the Mexican states, because the government was now bringing a federal lawsuit, rendering them redundant. This federal lawsuit represented the last chance for Mexico’s elected officials to get some compensation for the country’s fishermen and their families. According to a freedom of information response from the foreign ministry, the lawsuit didn’t make any progress in the US legal system between May 2013 and March 2018, when the Mexican government decided to settle the case against BP. This decision was based on a voluntary dismissal agreement, seen by BuzzFeed News, which was cosigned by the government and BP in February 2018, clearing the oil giant of any responsibility for damage to Mexican waters in exchange for $25.5 million. The US legal firm hired to represent Mexico, Schulte Roth & Zabel, was paid nearly $2 million by the Mexican government between 2010 and 2017 (figures for the final 2018 payments are not available). Schulte Roth & Zabel declined to be interviewed for this story. One of the lawyers representing more than 10,000 Mexican fishermen in their lawsuit, Horacio Polanco, expressed his anger that only people north of the border are getting paid out by BP. “The only injustice is that the payments are exclusively for the Americans,” Polanco said. He is still waiting for his day in court many years after filing, and is upset that the federal government prevented him from getting valuable evidence that he would need to bolster the Mexican fishermen’s case, by blocking access to its own studies for years. BP did not accept any responsibility for damage to the territory of Mexico, and while the lawsuits against the company stagnated, BP quickly moved into Mexico’s new energy market, investing heavily in Peña Nieto’s energy reform. This 2014 reform was undoubtedly Peña Nieto’s most surprising initiative — opening up the country’s nationalized energy sector to foreign investment for the first time in 80 years. Four rounds of bidding were to take place before Peña Nieto left office; in the first three rounds more than 100 oil development contracts were sold with a promised investment of more than $100 billion. If handled fairly, many economists hoped it would mark a revolutionary moment in Mexico’s fortunes. Oil companies were lining up at the door to bid in Mexico’s auctions, from supermajors like Shell and Chevron to lesser-known companies from China and Canada, as well as Mexico’s formally state-owned oil company, Pemex. People like Polanco do not understand why the government invited BP to the party. “BP wants to be Mexico’s partner in the exploitation of deepwater deposits,” Polanco said, looking bewildered. “How are you going to give a seat at your table to someone who doesn’t treat you with respect?” BP did very well at the table, winning the drilling rights to three oil blocks in the Gulf of Mexico; a 25% stake and a 50% stake in two other Gulf drilling sites through a subsidiary company called Pan American; and two natural gas pipeline contracts; and securing a deal to open 1,500 BP-branded gas stations by 2021. The foreign ministry told BuzzFeed News there had been no conflict of interest when negotiating these deals with BP. The new drill sites will add to the four production platforms BP still operates in US waters in the Gulf, which produce more than 300,000 barrels a day. BP plans to begin drilling first near Veracruz and Tabasco in 2020 — just off the coast of Tonalá. Jiménez, the fisherman, spent a quiet afternoon in June reflecting on a recent trip he took to see his lawyer in the coastal city of Veracruz. He was surrounded by siblings, children, and grandkids, who looked on as he spoke of his shock at seeing a gas station with a big BP sunflower sign, “calmly working, as if they hadn’t done anything here.” The fisherman will have to get used to it — BP-branded gas stations have been sprouting up around the country, and already exist in over half of Mexico’s 31 states, including Veracruz and Tabasco. “And now they’re going to work the [oil] platforms?” he scoffed. “It’s going to make it all worse.” Jiménez can only watch as BP invests in Mexico, including nearly $200 million in the oil blocks nearby, which are now set for drilling in less than two years. This week, on Sept. 29, according to the government’s official energy sector auction website, BP is going to announce its final work program and budget for the project. “Why don’t they want to solve the problem they made with us?” Jiménez asked. “They’re already in the country, taking the money from here. The government’s accepted the company to come in, like, Juan por su casa, as they say,” a colloquial expression for when somebody comes into your home and does as they please. The Jiménez family home is a ramshackle one-room hut; the waterproof screens that protect it during the rainy season are partly made of repurposed political banners from past election campaigns, including some from Peña Nieto’s Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. Peña Nieto’s term has been controversial, to say the least. His approval ratings hit record lows, and were already below 20% when the energy reform’s gasoline price hike — known as the gasolinazo — took effect in 2017, leading to protests across the country. A slew of corruption scandals, like the Casa Blanca case that involved Peña Nieto’s wife’s mysterious purchase of a luxury home from a preferred government contractor, further fueled widespread distrust in the government. By his final year in office in 2018, Mexico hit unheard-of levels of violence — July was the bloodiest month on record, surpassing the previous peak in May. For many in Mexico, Peña Nieto’s time couldn’t end soon enough. “We’re forgotten by the rulers, the politicians, the presidents,” said Edel Jiménez, Evelio’s older brother. “We just exist now. We lived from fishing. But now that’s over.” Their anger reflects a mood across the country, which saw the overwhelming victory of the leftist populist López Obrador in this summer’s election. After his win, he told a gathering of thousands of his supporters in Mexico City that when he officially takes office in December, “we will respect everyone, but we will give preference to the most humble and forgotten.” That night, he took aim specifically at Peña Nieto’s energy reform, saying his administration would revise all the contracts signed, and if they found “anomalies” they would “take the legal route” in both national and international courts. “Under no circumstance will [I] allow corruption, nor impunity.” Pedro Joaquin Coldwell, Mexico's energy minister (left), shakes hands with Chris Sladen, then president of BP Mexico, March 9, 2017. On Feb. 15, 2018, the Mexican government agreed to the $25.5 million payout from BP, in return for settling their lawsuit, clearing the transnational energy giant of all damages to Mexican waters. Court documents regarding the voluntary dismissal, minutes from various meetings of governmental bodies from 2014 to 2017, and a review of academic papers based on classified scientific studies appear to show the government ignored scientific evidence regarding BP’s blame for the spill. Instead, the government accepted what seems to be a one-sided deal. Trying to get to the bottom of the backroom negotiations between BP and the Mexican government required two years of freedom of information requests, and reviewing thousands of documents. The government routinely returned heavily redacted documents, questions were repeatedly ignored, and the few responses provided were riddled with spelling mistakes and incorrect information, even on such basic items as dates and costs. But what limited responses they did give paint a picture of an administration failing to put its citizens first. Following a request in 2016, the foreign ministry initially said they could not provide information about the status of the government lawsuit, saying that to do so “would jeopardize our country’s claims to reach a compensation.” The following year, the INECC said it would not provide the conclusions of its reports because they were classified while the case was ongoing. In May 2018, the various scientific bodies that had studied the spill said they were not allowed to release their work without the say-so of the INECC. The INECC subsequently passed the buck to the foreign ministry, saying that “the possibility of declassifying [the studies] is currently being reviewed with the foreign ministry.” But this was months after the Mexican government had accepted the $25.5 million payment that acquitted BP of any wrongdoing, and after it dismissed its own lawsuit in March. There appeared to be no legal justification for withholding the studies once the Louisiana court had accepted the government’s voluntary dismissal. A review of the minutes of meetings held at the foreign ministry in Mexico City reveals that officials had in fact been discussing a possible negotiation with BP from at least February 2017. Members of the INECC, the foreign ministry, and their US lawyers then met with BP representatives in New York in July 2017 to negotiate the settlement, which was officially filed in a US court in February 2018, according to minutes seen by BuzzFeed News. During these meetings, BP offered an initial payment of $20 million. In October 2017, Mexican officials prepared a counterproposal of $50 million. BP would go no higher than half that, $25.5 million. According to the 2018 settlement agreement, obtained by BuzzFeed News, $15.3 million is for “the reimbursement of Mexico’s past monitoring investigation and other costs related to the Deepwater Horizon incident.” $10.2 million is to be paid to the INECC for “Mexican programs for the socio-environmental protection, conservation and/or restoration of the Gulf of Mexico.” There is no detailed explanation of exactly how the money will be spent, or who will ensure the money is distributed fairly. This is peanuts compared to BP’s $500 million, 10-year program to monitor US waters set up just over a month after the spill, with yearly conferences to present findings, discuss solutions, and continue in the recuperation of the US Gulf ecosystem. Let alone the over $60 billion BP has paid to US interests as compensation for the spill. The legal document about the agreement and dismissal says that the settlement will remain confidential unless both parties agree to release the information. To date, there has been no BP or government announcement about the dismissal or the payment. $15.3 million should have been paid out by May 15. The final $10.2 million is set to be sent on Nov. 30 — the last day of Peña Nieto’s presidency. The foreign ministry and the INECC said the first tranche had been deposited by BP into the country’s treasury. Both noted they would not be responsible for overseeing how the money was spent. The final payment would go to an as-yet-unspecified program and both agencies said they were unsure who would oversee it. It is unclear whether any Mexican fishermen will receive any of the money. Evelio Jiménez prepares fish in the kitchen of his restaurant, El Buzo, in Tonalá. The Mexican government may have given up its own lawsuit, but there is good reason to believe that the all-important hydrocarbon fingerprint might actually have been found — and possibly ignored. BuzzFeed News can reveal that the Mexican government was provided evidence that scientists may have located the BP fingerprint in Mexican waters. The evidence was presented as part of the separate state lawsuits by a scientist named Sergio Jiménez. In a signed affidavit filed in the Louisiana court from Jan. 24, 2013, seen by BuzzFeed News, Jiménez (who is not related to the Jiménez fishing family) said that he conclusively tracked oil onto the Tamaulipas shores, calling it “an identical match to the fingerprint provided by BP in the Deepwater Horizon litigation.” Jiménez, who worked for more than a decade as the government’s master oceanographer for the Tamaulipas border region, said he also discovered oil plumes as far south as Veracruz in 2011 that “continue to impact its shores and marine life.” Sergio Jiménez told BuzzFeed News he stood by his statement, saying he had enough findings “to show that there was damage to the Mexican coastline, at least in Tamaulipas, due to the effects of the BP spill.” Freedom of information requests reveal that, during a January 2014 meeting, various arms of the Mexican government — including the foreign ministry and the INECC — discussed using evidence from the state lawsuits against BP. This predates the federal government’s lawsuit, and it is unclear why this evidence was never used. Sergio Jiménez was not the only scientist to potentially discover the fingerprint. In July, the government finally published 20 of its 22 studies online, following repeated freedom of information requests. But the presentation of the studies was problematic — many of the links initially didn’t work, some of the studies were listed as “in development” although they had ended years before, and others just had the name of the study with no hyperlink. Only after an official appeal to Mexico’s transparency agency by BuzzFeed News were the studies put online in full in August. It’s unclear why the government would be so reluctant to release its findings. Most of them were filled with little more than statements that additional research into the effects of the spill was needed, or that it could not be conclusively proven that BP polluted Mexican waters. None of the 20 released studies claimed to have discovered the all-important fingerprint. But two studies remain classified, both conducted by the country’s Petroleum Institute (IMP). The IMP’s studies were the last ones approved before Peña Nieto’s 2014 energy reform. The IMP said that it was barred under federal law from releasing them because they contained “industrial secrets and/or commercial secrets,” claiming “the sites where [the IMP] worked have been hardly studied so the information by itself is strategic.” The IMP then added to that vague statement, that “also [the IMP] reports that the conclusions of the studies don’t reveal environmental damages.” However, while the government continued to withhold their work, five IMP scientists published a 2017 article in the Marine Pollution Bulletin, a peer-reviewed academic journal. The scientists detailed how they traced the 2010 spill into Mexican waters, saying they had discovered a number of oil pollutants in over half of the deepwater locations in their studies and that “the [Deepwater Horizon] oil spill is a likely source of such pollutants.” The lead scientist of the IMP studies, who was a coauthor of the 2017 article, declined an interview request from BuzzFeed News, saying that as an IMP investigator she was not authorized to speak to the media. Traffic in Mexico City on March 10, 2017. Peña Nieto gave few interviews during his time in office, but in late August he made the rounds with several prominent Mexican TV programs and newspapers, reflecting on his time in office. He stuck to the same themes, about history judging him, and being proud of what he had accomplished, specifically saying that his reforms would be his “most important legacy, because the development of these reforms will translate into greater economic growth, generating greater opportunities for Mexicans.” López Obrador takes office on Dec. 1 and he has said one of his first orders of business will be to make sure the energy reform is carried out cleanly. He’s already pushed back the final round of oil contract bids until early next year. When he held a meeting in his home state of Tabasco earlier this month with representatives from foreign and domestic companies across the energy sector, he warned the audience there would be a “zero-tolerance policy” when it comes to the oil industry. But whether López Obrador will follow through on all his big plans is a point of skepticism for many. Most of his campaign promises are still being fleshed out, and many are left wondering what he actually plans to do. Mauricio Gómez — Evelio Jiménez’s son-in-law — quit school when he was 6 to become a fisherman, but now he claims he can barely feed his three daughters. He repeatedly said that he felt “humiliated,” by both the Mexican government and BP. He hoped López Obrador would finally address the issue of what happened in the Gulf of Mexico, claiming that few people in the country were as “abandoned” as the coastal fishermen. “No candidate takes the fishermen into account. None. They’ve always taken into account the oil industry, which is the one that works with the government,” said Gómez angrily. “We don’t exist to the government.” The oldest of Gómez’s three daughters will soon graduate from high school. She lay in a hammock nearby, and when asked if she planned to join the family business she said no, because “there aren’t enough fish left.” Instead, she planned to join the navy and work for the government who her father says abandoned them. Why? “So I can still work on the sea,” she said. ● Evelio Jiménez and his daughter Anel on the beach in Tonalá.

Russia’s oil industry was plunged into a crisis in April after about 5 million tonnes of oil for export was found to be contaminated with organic chloride, a chemical used to help boost oil extraction but which can damage refining equipment. Exports through the Druzhba pipeline that transports oil to Germany, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Ukraine and Belarus were halted. The Baltic port of Ust Luga loaded some 15 cargoes or 1.5 million tonnes of the contaminated oil for Western buyers. At least 6 cargoes that sailed from Ust Luga remain unsold, according the trading sources. Glencore is stuck with 500,000 tonnes in one very large crude carrier (VLCC) Amyntas and two smaller tankers - Searanger and Searuby, according to the sources and Refinitiv Eikon vessel tracking system. BP has tried to sell its cargo Fsl Shanghai at a tender earlier this month but failed, according to the same traders. BP and Glencore both bought the oil from Russian state oil major Rosneft. BP and Glencore declined to comment. Rosneft did not respond to a Reuters request to comment. They cannot claim compensation until they sell the oil. “You can’t file a claim against Russia until you have actually sold your oil and counted your losses,” one of the trading sources said. President Vladimir Putin said in April oil contamination had damaged Russia’s image as a reliable supplier. Transneft and Rosneft have been at loggerheads over efforts to resolve the situation. The oil was transported by pipeline monopoly Transneft, which said it was ready to pay compensation to Russian shippers which in turn would pay compensations to overseas buyers. Transneft and the Russian Energy ministry did not respond to Reuters requests to comment. So far, Transneft has only agreed to pay $15 per barrel in compensation, or roughly a quarter of the cost of the oil, to Kazakh oil producers, whose barrels got contaminated while en route to Western markets. “Many buyers of Russian oil believe $15 per barrel won’t be enough,” a trading source in a major said. Some consumers who received tainted oil consider $30 per barrel as reasonable compensation, two traders involved in the discussions said. Several refiners, including Total’s Leuna in Germany, had to temporarily suspend refining of Russian oil because of fears of damaging refining equipment. Another source with a large Western buyer said consumers would most likely file claims in the autumn when they finally manage to refine the dirty oil. Oil firms have to blend one barrel of tainted oil with as much as 10 barrels of clean oil to reach required quality standards and avoid damaging equipment, sources said. Total, for example, offloaded its two tankers with dirty oil in Rotterdam and Lithuania for storage and blending and further refining. Russian oil supplies along the Druzhba pipeline to Germany, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic have resumed in July after weeks of severely reduced flows. Russia exported 24% less oil to Germany in the first six months of 2019, year-on-year, due to contamination although it still remained Germany’s top crude supplier. Some refiners like Total’s Leuna and Poland’s PKN Plock are blending tainted oil with cleaner barrels and are refining it.

Belarus has finished full clean-up of its system after Transneft pumped some 2 million tonnes of dirty oil back to Russia, Transneft and traders said. Transneft now needs to dilute the oil with cleaner supplies to domestic refineries and export destinations.

673,2016-01-12 11:42:54,2016,1.0,12,Stanley Reed,"Stung by Low Oil Prices, BP Will Cut 4,000 Jobs","LONDON — The persistent plunge in oil prices has translated into a new round of industry job cuts. The British oil giant BP said on Tuesday it would eliminate 4,000 of the approximately 24,000 positions in its exploration and production units this year. That would be in addition to about 4,000 jobs that the company cut last year, when it trimmed its work force to about 80,000. “We have to make sure we have a competitive and sustainable business,” David Nicholas, a company spokesman, said by telephone. “External market conditions are getting tougher.” After oil prices began dropping in 2014, BP was among the companies warning that the price plunge could be deep and sustained. After falling about one-third last year, prices are down an additional 15 percent in the first 12 days of 2016. Brent crude, the international benchmark, was 3.3 percent lower at $30.50 a barrel in afternoon trading on Tuesday. West Texas intermediate, the American benchmark, dropped 4.3 percent, to $30.05; at one point on Tuesday, it fell below $30 for the first time since 2003. An estimated 250,000 oil industry jobs have been lost worldwide since the long price decline began. Royal Dutch Shell, BP’s biggest European rival, cut 7,500 jobs last year. Jonathan French, a Shell spokesman, said that if his company’s acquisition of the BG Group, a producer of oil and natural gas based in Reading, England, was completed in the coming weeks as expected, an additional 2,800 jobs would most likely be eliminated across the two companies. Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s. Some analysts expect the price slide to continue as there is no sign that perceptions of oversupply will ease and because of factors like the rise of the dollar, which puts pressure on the prices of commodities, including oil. “In an oversupplied market, there is no intrinsic value for crude oil,” analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Assuming continued dollar appreciation, “$20-to-$25 oil price scenarios are possible simply due to currency,” they wrote. BP did not specify where the job cuts would come from. But employees in Scotland, where BP has operations in the North Sea, said they had been told that 600 full-time and contractor jobs would be cut there over the next two years. When oil was selling at about $100 a barrel, companies complained about high costs and about marginal profitability in the North Sea. Even though companies have been cutting expenses, current prices are likely to push them into making deeper cuts or considering shutting some fields. BP has sought to reduce the size of its staff in recent years as a response to lower oil and gas prices, as well as to the sales of oil and gas fields and other assets to raise money after its Gulf of Mexico spill in 2010. Mr. Nicholas said the job reductions would not halt BP’s Clair Ridge and Quad 204 partnerships in waters north of Scotland. Once developments are well underway, it is very difficult to shut them down. BP’s operations in Alaska, Angola, Azerbaijan and the Gulf of Mexico are also considered possible areas for job cuts.",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/13/business/energy-environment/bp-jobs-oil-prices.html,business,The New York Times
674,2016-02-25 21:27:21,2016,2.0,25,The Associated Press,BP Engineer Is Not Guilty in Case From 2010 Gulf Oil Spill,"NEW ORLEANS — A former BP rig engineer was found not guilty Thursday on a charge that his negligence in interpreting a critical test that contributed to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Robert Kaluza was a rig supervisor aboard the Deepwater Horizon offshore rig when it exploded, killing 11 workers and resulting in millions of gallons of oil spewing into the Gulf. He was charged with a single count of violating the federal Clean Water Act and could have faced up to a year in prison if convicted. Jurors got the case Thursday afternoon and reached a verdict after less than two hours. Mr. Kaluza, 65, declined to comment. Prosecutors told jurors that Mr. Kaluza and a former co-defendant, Donald Vidrine, had botched a crucial pressure test indicating oil and gas could be flowing from deep beneath the sea floor into BP’s Macondo well, which was thought to be securely plugged with cement and mud. Shaun Clarke, Mr. Kaluza’s defense lawyer, said Mr. Vidrine, who pleaded guilty earlier in the case, was the one who had declared the test a success — after Mr. Kaluza’s watch aboard the rig had ended. Other rig workers agreed, he said. Mr. Clarke characterized Mr. Kaluza as a scapegoat. Mr. Kaluza had faced more serious charges. He and Mr. Vidrine were initially indicted on federal manslaughter and “seaman’s manslaughter” charges. But the seaman’s manslaughter counts were thrown out by the courts, and government prosecutors late last year backed away from the rest. Mr. Kaluza’s was the latest in a series of individual legal cases arising from the disaster. As for Mr. Vidrine, he is set to be sentenced in April. Prosecutors have recommended no prison time and 10 months of probation. The former BP executive David Rainey was acquitted last June of manipulating calculations to match a far-too-low estimate of the amount of oil spewing into the gulf. A former BP engineer, Kurt Mix, was convicted of obstruction of justice in 2013 for deleting a string of text messages, but accusations of juror misconduct led a judge to order a new trial, and Mr. Mix ultimately made a deal with prosecutors. He pleaded guilty last month to a lesser charge and was sentenced to six months of probation. The oil company itself pleaded guilty to criminal charges, and faces billions of dollars in civil and criminal penalties.",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/business/energy-environment/bp-engineer-is-not-guilty-in-case-from-2010-gulf-oil-spill.html,business,The New York Times
675,2016-02-02 03:36:30,2016,2.0,2,"Clifford Krauss, Stanley Reed",Exxon Mobil’s Profits Fall and BP Cites Low Oil Prices in $3.3 Billion Loss,"HOUSTON — Over the last year the biggest oil companies have shown the most resilience in the face of plunging oil prices. But now even the likes of Exxon Mobil, BP and Chevron are beginning to lose their buoyancy. The newest measure of the oil industry’s falling fortunes came on Tuesday in the form of a $3.3 billion fourth-quarter loss reported by BP. Exxon Mobil, the American industry’s largest player, reported a 58 percent decline in its quarterly profit. Low oil and natural gas prices are saving families hundreds of dollars a year, but there are few cheers among energy executives. The entire industry is reeling from the effects of a global glut, and slackening international economic growth. Any prospect that big global producers like Saudi Arabia and Russia will cut production to reverse the 70 percent drop in oil prices over the last 18 months has been squashed in recent weeks. Iran has promised to add another 500,000 barrels a day to the world market now that several sanctions have been lifted after the recent nuclear deal. Global production exceeds demand by more than one million barrels a day, and storage space is running out. Longer term, there are questions about the value of oil still underground, as climate concerns prompt energy users of all sizes to seek alternatives to fossil fuels. Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s. This is the worst industry decline since similar commodity price collapses in the 1980s and 1990s forced oil companies to slash payrolls and dividends, although the biggest companies have generally fared far better than the smaller independents. BP and Exxon Mobil continue to pledge their commitment to their dividends, helped by the strong returns that refineries tend to show when oil and gas, vital raw inputs, are low. Senior oil executives noted that unseasonably warm weather had lowered demand for natural gas and that refining and chemical profit margins were weakening in some areas of the world. But despite the challenges, oil executives on Tuesday expressed confidence that their businesses would survive and prosper in the future, and that oil and gas prices would eventually rebound. “For both gas and oil we are constructive on long-term demand growth,” Jeffrey J. Woodbury, Exxon Mobil’s vice president for investor relations, said in a conference call. Speaking to reporters in London, Bob Dudley, BP’s chief executive, forecast that demand for oil would most likely catch up with falling output in the second half of this year, leading to an easing of the glut that has depressed prices. “As these start working together — the supply and demand fundamentals,” Mr. Dudley said, “you can characterize the price as lower for longer but it’s not lower forever.” Nevertheless, as oil prices slumped again on Tuesday by about 5 percent, Exxon Mobil shares were down 2.2 percent and BP shares shed 8.5 percent of their value. The American benchmark oil price broke just under $30 a barrel, a level that makes drilling unprofitable almost everywhere in the United States. Exxon Mobil’s profit of $2.78 billion was down from $6.57 billion the year before. Its exploration and production business lost $538 million in the United States, though its total global upstream earnings for the quarter were $857 million. For all of 2015, the company’s net income of $16.2 billion was roughly half that of 2014. The results would have been far worse had it not been for the company’s refining and chemical businesses. It had refining and marketing earnings of $1.35 billion, up from $497 million the year before. With the price of oil near $30 a barrel, the company said it would pare share repurchases as a cost-saving measure. “We have built this business to ensure it is durable in a low-price environment,” Mr. Woodbury said. For all of 2015, BP said it lost $6.48 billion, compared with a profit of $3.78 billion in 2014 — before plummeting oil prices began taking their full toll. On Tuesday, BP repeated a commitment it made last month to cut 4,000 jobs this year in its exploration and production unit, which lost $728 million in the quarter. BP also said it would trim about 3,000 workers from its marketing and refining business by the end of 2017. Before those cuts, BP had a global work force of about 80,000. The company also said it wrote down the value of its oil and gas assets by $1.6 billion in the quarter in response to plunging prices. Hoping to keep more investors from fleeing, BP said on Tuesday that despite its financial losses it would keep its dividend unchanged. BP has sought to streamline its operations by selling some businesses — a strategy in some ways forced by its need to raise money to help pay damages from its oil well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The company took a charge of $443 million in the fourth quarter for that spill, bringing total provisions for the disaster to $55.5 billion. Since 2010, the company has raised about $60 billion through sales of assets including stakes in three large Gulf of Mexico oil fields in 2012 and a Texas refinery in 2013. Most of those sales were made when oil prices were much higher than today. Other companies are finding it hard to find buyers for businesses or operations they might want to sell. The American oil giant Chevron, for example, cited that problem last week when it reported its first quarterly loss since 2002. “It is a terrible market to be trying to sell most assets out there,” John S. Watson, the chairman and chief executive of Chevron, said on Friday during a conference call with analysts. Chevron lost $588 million in the last quarter of 2015, compared with a $3.5 billion profit in the period a year earlier. An earlier version of this article misstated Exxon Mobil’s exploration and production business earnings. ExxonMobil reported a loss of $538 million in the United States only; it reported an overall global profit of $857 million in those businesses. In addition, because of an editing error, the article misstated the period in which BP took a $443 million charge related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.

BP has eliminated thousands of jobs and cut investments over the last year, but Mr. Dudley’s pay has risen steadily since he took office after the 2010 spill, and it has become apoint of tension with shareholders. The company’s annual shareholder meeting is next month.

677,2016-03-21 16:02:15,2016,3.0,21,Clifford Krauss,BP and Statoil Pull Employees From Algeria Gas Fields After Attack,"BP and the Norwegian oil company Statoil announced on Monday that they were withdrawing their employees from two of Algeria’s largest natural gas fields after Islamic terrorists staged the second attack in three years on their installations. In the assault, on Friday, a rocket-propelled grenade attack hit the In Salah natural gas field and processing plant in Krechba, 750 miles south of Algiers. BP, a British company, and Statoil operate the installation jointly with the Algerian national oil company Sonatrach. The attack on the plant did not result in damage or casualties, according to the companies, and production was interrupted only briefly. The Algerian Army rushed to secure the area, but the episode highlighted the difficulty it has in defending the country’s oil and gas fields, which stretch across a wide swath of the Sahara. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Al Qaeda’s North Africa affiliate, claimed responsibility soon after the attack on In Salah, Algeria’s third-largest gas field. In an online statement, the group said the assault was part of its “war on the interests of the crusaders.” The group also suggested that it aimed to protect the environment and discourage shale gas exploration. Three years ago, a splinter Qaeda group attacked another gas facility at In Amenas, not far from the Libyan border. The same three oil companies operate that facility. Forty people were killed during a four-day siege then, and damages were so heavy that one processing plant remains out of operation. The latest attack was far more modest than the 2013 assault, staged by only a handful of terrorists armed with simple weaponry. “It was a limited attack,” said Geoff D. Porter, head of North Africa Risk Consulting, who is visiting Algeria. “It is a reflection of the limited capabilities that the group has in Algeria.” Nevertheless, Mr. Porter added: “It is going to have a dampening effect” on foreign investment. Operations at both of the facilities from which BP and Statoil are withdrawing will be operated by Algerian personnel. It was not immediately clear how long the two major European oil companies would keep their expatriate personnel, which together number several dozen, away from the facilities. But they indicated they were still committed to operating in Algeria, Africa’s largest natural gas producer and a primary source of energy for Europe. “BP’s first priority is the safety and security of people,” the company said in a statement. It said the decision to conduct a “phased temporary relocation” “has been taken as a precautionary measure.” BP added that it would continue to support the ventures remotely. After the 2013 In Amenas attack, the Algerian government instituted several new antiterrorism measures, including tougher security checks on local energy employees and wide-ranging air surveillance of the country’s oil and gas fields and installations. Despite a long history of political violence, Algeria has been relatively peaceful in recent years compared with its neighbors, particularly Libya. But it has had difficulties attracting foreign investment to increase its sagging oil and natural gas production because of security concerns, corruption and investment laws that some companies find onerous.",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/22/business/energy-environment/bp-and-statoil-pull-employees-from-algeria-gas-fields-after-attack.html,business,The New York Times
678,2016-03-11 14:11:11,2016,3.0,11,Stanley Reed,BP to End Sponsorship of Tate Museums,"LONDON — BP has decided to end its 26-year sponsorship of the Tate group of art museums, one of Britain’s most high-profile cultural institutions, the energy giant and Tate said on Friday. The sponsorship has been the target of protesters for years, including after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010 when activists poured a slick substance on the steps of Tate Britain, but a BP spokesman said the oil company was ending the arrangement purely for financial reasons. The spokesman, David Nicholas, said it was “a commercial decision” prompted by the collapse in oil prices which has led to a decline in BP’s profit since the summer of 2014. Last month, BP reported a $6.5 billion loss for 2015. Mr. Nicholas said that at a time when BP was cutting thousands of jobs and slashing investment, “our arts sponsorship program does not have an exemption.” Activists who have protested the funding described the decision as a major victory that could pressure other cultural institutions to end their corporate ties. “We’re thrilled with the news Tate is rid of BP,” Yasmin de Silva, a member of one of the protest group Liberate Tate, said in a statement. “About 30 years ago, the tide turned on tobacco sponsorship, and now the same thing is happening to the oil industry.” BP’s sponsorship of Tate dates from 1990. It has largely focused on Tate Britain, the museum in the Pimlico area of London that houses work by British artists like J.M.W. Turner and William Blake. Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s. The oil company sponsors the display of Tate Britain’s permanent collection as well as special features like a branded “BP Walk through British Art” in the museum’s galleries. At first glance, the loss of BP’s existing contribution, which was reported in January 2015 to be about 224,000 pounds, or nearly $319,000, a year over 17 years, may not seem like a major loss to a museum with an operating income of £92 million. But the decision to halt the sponsorship comes as government funding for cultural institutions, which accounts for about one-third of Tate’s income, is under pressure in Britain. “The BP/Tate partnership has been an outstanding example of patronage and collaboration over nearly 30 years,” the museum said in a statement on Friday. Tate’s other institutions in England include Tate Modern on the south bank of the Thames in London and museums in Liverpool and Cornwall. Tate is one of four major British cultural institutions with longstanding funding arrangements from BP. The oil company also contributes to the Royal Opera House, British Museum and National Portrait Gallery. In 2011, BP said it would spend a total of £10 million on the four institutions over the following five years. Mr. Nicolas, the spokesman, said that BP had no plans to stop sponsoring the other institutions, adding that the Tate deal was the first to come up for renewal. The flow of BP support to Tate is to end in the first quarter of next year, when the arrangement expires. The protests against BP’s relationship with Tate have also included a legal action to compel the museum to reveal the amount of the sponsorship, a demonstration at Turbine Hall at Tate Modern, and a brief occupation of part of Tate Britain in November in which activists tattooed environmental messages on one another. In a telephone interview, Mel Evans, a member of Liberate Tate, said she hoped that other institutions would end their relationships with BP and other oil companies. “We think it’s important that art space is protected for the public and not co-opted by an oil company,” she said.",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/12/business/energy-environment/bp-to-end-sponsorship-of-tate-museums.html,business,The New York Times
679,2016-04-26 04:25:59,2016,4.0,26,Stanley Reed,BP Reports $583 Million Loss in First Quarter,"LONDON — BP, the first of the major oil companies to report earnings this week, said on Tuesday that it had lost $583 million in the first quarter of 2016, compared with a $2.6 billion profit in the same period last year. Lower oil prices were behind the loss for BP, whose results were nonetheless better than analysts had expected. That, and the fact that the company said it would keep its dividend at 10 cents a share, helped buoy BP’s share price, which was up more than 3 percent in midmorning trading in London. In the current environment, analysts say an oil company’s stock price is largely determined by the dividend. Sustaining it is “the first priority within our financial framework,” BP’s chief financial officer, Brian Gilvary, told analysts in a conference call on Tuesday. BP said it had lost $1.2 billion in its key oil and gas exploration and production unit, which was a big money earner when prices were high. Oil prices for the quarter averaged $34 a barrel for Brent crude, more than a third lower than a year earlier. “The entire industry is going to be loss-making in the first quarter,” Oswald Clint, an analyst at Bernstein Research in London, wrote in an email. To maintain the dividend despite low prices, BP has been cutting costs, which were $4.6 billion lower for the last four quarters combined than in full-year 2014. The company has not only been reducing its staff by thousands but also paring its sponsorship of the arts. This year, the company said it would end its support for the Tate museums in Britain. BP’s chief executive, Robert W. Dudley, who has been more pessimistic about oil prices than some industry colleagues, seemed to detect brightening prospects. “Market fundamentals continue to suggest that the combination of robust demand and weak supply growth will move global oil markets closer into balance by the end of the year,” Mr. Dudley said in a news release on Tuesday. Exxon Mobil and Chevron, the two largest American oil companies, are expected to post their results on Friday. Since dropping below $30 a barrel in January, oil prices have recovered to about $45 a barrel. That was in part because of the possibility that major producers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia would cap production. Those hopes were dashed this month at a meeting in Doha, Qatar, however, when Saudi Arabia refused to go along with a production ceiling unless Iran signed on as well. The fading of OPEC as a force in the markets presents a problem for large international oil companies like BP. These companies have long benefited from OPEC’s limiting oil supplies to keep prices high. Now that OPEC has lost cohesion, the expensive projects that made sense during the $100-a-barrel era often no longer add up economically, analysts say. If OPEC is no longer effective, neither is the old business model of the international oil companies, Paul Stevens, an oil analyst at the London-based research institution Chatham House, wrote in a forthcoming article. This month, BP shareholders dealt a symbolic rebuke to the company by voting against Mr. Dudley’s $19.6 million compensation package for 2015. Investors were critical of giving him a 20 percent pay increase in a year when the company reported a $6.5 billion loss. The vote was nonbinding but may influence BP’s treatment of future executive compensation, the company said. The company also took a $917 million write-off for damage claims from the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil disaster, bringing total provisions for liabilities from that accident to $56.4 billion.",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/27/business/international/bp-earnings-q1.html,business,The New York Times
680,2016-04-14 12:13:24,2016,4.0,14,Stanley Reed,BP Shareholders Send ‘a Message’ Protesting Chief’s Pay,"LONDON — In a symbolic slap against high executive pay at a money-losing company, BP shareholders have voted against the $19.6 million compensation package for the chief executive, Robert W. Dudley. Though it was a nonbinding vote that will not affect Mr. Dudley’s pay for the year past, a BP spokesman said on Thursday at the annual shareholders meeting that investors had sent “a message to the board” that might influence deliberations on a new pay policy. The policy will be submitted to shareholders at the annual meeting next year, in a vote that will be binding, said the spokesman, David Nicholas. Investors have chafed at Mr. Dudley’s receiving a 20 percent increase in overall compensation, despite a $6.5 billion loss reported by the company for 2015, as sharply lower oil prices exacted a severe toll on profits. According to BP, the tally of proxy votes cast before Thursday’s annual general meeting in London was 59.1 percent against and 40.9 percent in favor. There are still additional votes to be counted, but they are unlikely to significantly alter the proportions, Mr. Nicholas said. As is legally required at British companies, the BP chief executive’s pay is determined by a formula that is put to a vote by shareholders every three years. BP’s current formula was approved by about 96 percent of shareholders in 2014, Mr. Nicholas said. Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s. At Thursday’s meeting, Carl-Henric Svanberg, BP’s chairman, told shareholders that the board was aware of their concerns. “Let me be clear: We hear you,” Mr. Svanberg said, according to a transcript provided by BP. “We will sit down with our largest shareholders to make sure we understand their concerns,” he said. Mr. Svanberg also said that the board had always “judged executive performance not on the price of oil or bottom-line profit but on measures that are clearly within management’s control.” And from that perspective, “the board has concluded that it has been an outstanding year,’’ he said. “The pay reflects this and it is consistent with our policy.” A shareholder adviser, Tim Bush, called it “an unprecedented vote.” The 59 percent opposition was the highest dissenting vote yet cast against a large company in Britain under the country’s current remuneration laws, said Mr. Bush, head of governance and analysis at PIRC, a London-based shareholder advisory group. PIRC had recommended that shareholders oppose the pay package for Mr. Dudley and other BP executives as “excessive” and out of line with shareholder returns. Since Mr. Dudley took over at BP after the Gulf of Mexico disaster in 2010 that killed 11 people and spilled millions of barrels of oil, he has made significant changes, including selling major assets. He is also credited with improving safety awareness at the London-based giant. BP has been responding to lower oil prices by reducing costs. Besides cutting thousands of jobs, the company said recently that it would end its sponsorship of the Tate Museums in London.",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/15/business/bob-dudley-pay-bp-shareholders.html,business,The New York Times

Eleven people were arrested in connection with trespassing. There have been protests against other BP-sponsored exhibitions at the museum, including “Shakespeare: Staging the World” in 2012, and “Vikings: Life and Legend” in 2014, but this was the first time the museum had to close. The protest follows another made by the theatrical group “BP or not BP” on Tuesday evening during a V.I.P. reception for “Sunken Cities,” which displays artifacts from two lost Egyptian cities buried under the sea. The British Museum contains a breathtaking collection of over 8 million objects that paint an interconnected portrait of the world’s cultures. You could spend a week here, but we’ll guide you through. In a statement reported by the BBC, a spokesman for Greenpeace said that the organization was taking a stand “because of the irony of an oil company sponsoring an exhibition whose name practically spells out impacts of climate change. What were they thinking?” Greenpeace said that 85 people took part in the British Museum protest in which banners were revealed showing the names of cities threatened by climate change, and renaming the exhibition “Sinking Cities.” In March, BP announced that it would end its sponsorship of the Tate museums, where it has been a major financial donor for 20 years, in 2017. There too, protesters regularly objected to the sponsorship but the oil company said that it was ending the arrangement for financial reasons. In a statement the British Museum said that it was “grateful to BP for their long-term support which has allowed the museum to bring world cultures to a global audience through hugely popular exhibitions and their associated public programmes.”",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/arts/design/greenpeace-protest-of-bp-forces-british-museum-to-close.html,arts,The New York Times
683,2016-06-10 06:40:28,2016,6.0,10,Stanley Reed,"Adapting to Modest Oil Prices, BP Spins Off Norway Business Into New Venture","As it looks to navigate a period of more modest energy prices, BP said on Friday that it would merge its oil and gas operations in Norway with Det norske, a Norwegian exploration and development company. The deal, with the much smaller oil company controlled by the Norwegian industrial giant Aker, appears to be a way for BP to slim down while keeping a hand in Norway, a major oil and gas producing nation. The new company, to be called Aker BP, will also use its heft to take advantage of a weak energy environment to make targeted acquisitions. “BP needs, in this hypercompetitive world, to think about different commercial models in different places,” Robert Dudley, the British company’s chief executive, told analysts on Friday during a conference call. BP operates five oil and gas fields in Norwegian waters. There is the potential to expand some of these fields and extend their lives by finding new, usually smaller, oil and gas deposits around them and by tying them into existing platforms. But more efficient operations are required to make such opportunities profitable. Royal Dutch Shell recently said that it might exit operations in up to 10 countries where its oil and gas operations were too small to make financial sense. Oil giants like BP and Royal Dutch Shell acknowledge that smaller companies are often better at operating existing fields. Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s. In 2003, for example, Apache, a midsize company based in Houston, acquired part of the once-impressive Forties Oil Field in the North Sea from BP, where production had fallen more than 90 percent from peak levels. Apache has made a success of the deal, raising production about 20 percent. Analysts said BP, whose production would probably have otherwise declined in Norway, had found a low-risk way to try to bolster a weak business. “The transaction strengthens BP’s position in Norway, where it has long been underweight,” analysts at Bernstein Research in London wrote in a note to clients on Friday. BP’s exploration and production chief, Bernard Looney, said on the analysts’ call that Det norske’s lean approach would benefit the oil giant. The two sides expect the combined company, which now produces about 122,000 barrels a day, to double its output by the early 2020s. Mr. Dudley suggested that other deals might be in the offing. He has already created a separate subsidiary to operate BP’s shale oil and gas business in the United States. Like other oil companies, BP is under pressure to bring costs in line with the sharply reduced revenue resulting from lower oil prices, which are now in the range of $50 a barrel. In the first quarter of this year, BP lost $1.2 billion on its once-lucrative oil and gas exploration and production operations. BP has led the oil majors in selling assets because it also needed cash to pay for liabilities from its Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The oil giant has raised $60 billion through disposals in recent years. Under the deal announced on Friday, BP would have a 30 percent shareholding in the Oslo-listed Aker BP and receive $140 million in cash. Aker would have a 40 percent stake, and the other shareholders 30 percent.",http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/11/business/dealbook/bp-norway-aker.html,business,The New York Times
684,2016-08-18 19:59:46,2016,8.0,18,The Associated Press,2 Convicted and 5 Acquitted in BP Oil Spill Fraud Case,"JACKSON, Miss. — A jury convicted two people Thursday of making up fake clients to sue BP after the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, but acquitted a Texas lawyer and those closest to him of fraud and other charges. The defendants, including Mikal Watts, a San Antonio lawyer, were accused of making up names on a list of 40,000 people who wanted to sue BP. They faced 66 federal counts of mail fraud, wire fraud and identity theft and aggravated identity theft. Part of Mr. Watts’s defense was to blame two people who were convicted — Gregory Warren of Lafayette, La., and Thi Houng Le of Grand Bay, Ala.— telling jurors he got “ripped off” when he hired them to sign up clients. Mr. Watts and other investors spent almost $11 million to compile the list, but it was riddled with errors, including names of the dead, people who never gave permission for him to represent them and even a dog’s name. Prosecutors said Mr. Watts, his brother David Watts and a law firm employee, Wynter Lee, saw that the list was full of problems, but pressed on toward the prospect of a big legal payday. The plaintiffs were supposed to be paid from a $2.3 billion fund BP set aside to compensate fishermen. Mr. Watts and others denied they intended to commit fraud, a requirement for a conviction. Mr. Watts has been a prominent plaintiff’s lawyer representing thousands of clients in other cases and raising millions of dollars for President Obama and other Democrats. Gregory K. Davis, the United States attorney in Southern Mississippi, said in a statement that prosecutors respected the verdict, and he declined further comment. BP had initially sued Mr. Watts in 2013 regarding the client list, and the Secret Service and other federal agencies began a multiyear investigation. Jurors also acquitted Hector Eloy Guerra of Weslaco, Tex., a man whom prosecutors had said was the key link between Mr. Watts and Mr. Warren. Thi Hoang Nguyen of Grand Bay, Ala., was also acquitted.

There have been no injuries or reports of damage to wildlife, but crews trying to secure the well have failed amid frigid winds gusting to 38 miles an hour. Alaskan and federal officials have identified two leaks venting methane gas, a powerful greenhouse gas linked to climate change. While some crude has sprayed out of the well with the gas, BP said infrared cameras on a flight over the site appeared to confirm that the oil released was contained on the gravel pad surrounding the well head and did not reach the tundra. By Sunday afternoon, crews had shut down one leak with a surface safety valve, but the second leak, although reduced, was still spouting gas, federal and state officials said. Specialists from Boots and Coots, a well control company, were arriving in the area on Sunday to assist in closing down the well. The damaged well is on state land several miles outside Deadhorse, a remote town. “Crews are on the scene and are developing plans to bring the well under control,” said Brett Clanton, a BP spokesman, “and safety will remain our top priority as we move through this process.” He said that it was unknown how much gas had leaked and that the company would investigate the causes of the accident after repairs were made. Oil workers operating near the well were evacuated because of the possibility of an explosion. There are large quantities of gas in the northern Alaskan fields around Prudhoe Bay in part because, without enough pipelines to bring it to market, oil companies have been pumping excess gas back into the ground for decades. “The cause of the discharge is unknown at this time,” federal and state officials said in a statement late on Saturday. The statement said that an effort to secure the well on Friday night “was unsuccessful due to safety concerns and damage to a well pressure gauge.” BP has struggled to repair its reputation since the disastrous Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 that killed 11 rig workers. The new leak in an established production well, however, has little in common with the blowout of the ill-fated well in the Gulf of Mexico. That well was drilled for exploration purposes, and the accident was caused by a series of errors by BP and its service companies. Nevertheless, environmentalists were critical of BP. “Anytime you have an uncontrolled well, that is bad performance,” said Lois Epstein, the Arctic program director for the Wilderness Society, a conservation organization. “Deepwater Horizon was visible to everybody. The North Slope is far away and out of sight, out of mind to the public, and that’s why you and I are having a hard time getting the details.” This was just the latest in a series of leaks from petroleum operations that have plagued Alaska in recent months, although leaks have been rare on the North Slope. Last week, divers placed a clamp over a gash in an underwater Hilcorp Alaska pipeline in Cook Inlet, halting the flow of millions of cubic feet of natural gas. Alaskan oil production has been in a sharp decline in recent years as output from shale fields in Texas and North Dakota has come to dominate the industry. But the state may be poised for an oil renaissance, even after several companies have moved away from exploration offshore. ConocoPhillips, Repsol of Spain and Caelus Energy of Dallas have announced giant discoveries in recent months that could raise the state’s production considerably, especially if oil prices rise in the years to come. Some environmentalists seized on the new accident to campaign against all Arctic drilling. “This underscores the hazard and harm of drilling for oil in the Arctic and shows, yet again, that we have no business exposing more of this irreplaceable habitat to the peril of these inherently dangerous industrial operations,” said Bob Deans, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/16/business/bp-damaged-oil-well-alaskan-arctic.html,business,The New York Times
688,2017-12-15 09:28:59,2017,12.0,15,Stanley Reed,"BP, Once a Renewables Leader, Bets $200 Million on Solar","LONDON — BP had been at the forefront when it came to major oil companies going green. It invested billions in renewables. It was quick to acknowledge the link between fossil fuels and global warming. It adopted the slogan “Beyond Petroleum.” But that all fell by the wayside when the company was hit by the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. On Friday, in what may be a move to repolish tarnished green credentials, the energy giant said that it would spend $200 million to acquire a large stake in a Lightsource, a solar power developer based in Britain. BP, like other major European oil companies, is responding to pressure from investors and governments, especially in the region, to shift away from the traditional fossil fuels blamed for climate change, like oil and gas, and into cleaner sources of energy. Statoil, the Norwegian giant, for example, is staking out a big position in offshore wind, and Total, the French company, last year bought a battery maker called Saft for 950 million euros, or $1.1 billion. “The European majors feel under pressure to diversify, to get exposure to different technologies so they are not left out,” said Valentina Kretzschmar, an analyst at energy consultants Wood Mackenzie. “It is what a lot of their peer group is doing.” Indeed, renewables like solar and wind power are increasingly seen as not just a science experiment or a concession to political and environmental pressures, but a good business opportunity in their own right. Wood Mackenzie estimates that renewable energy products return between 7 percent and 10 percent on capital invested. That figure is much lower, however, than the 18 percent in estimated average returns that a drilling project offers, in part because the newer technologies are in regulated industries where profits tend to be capped. But, Ms. Kretzschmar said, energy companies must at least test the waters to make sure they are in the game when renewables do take off. Today’s energy jobs are in solar and, increasingly, wind power, rather than coal. But jobs are unevenly distributed across the country. Before the Gulf of Mexico oil spill hobbled the company, BP had been seen as a leader on environmental issues among traditional oil and gas companies. It said in 1997 that greenhouse gases resulting from the burning of fossil fuels played a role in global warming, and began making investments to offset their impact. Under John Browne, chief executive from 1995 to 2007, BP invested around $8 billion in renewable energy early in the 2000s, including solar power, though with mixed results at best. Under pressure to pay damages and fines from the Gulf of Mexico spill — which have cost it $64 billion so far — BP has been focusing until recently on improving its oil and gas operations. Though BP still has a large wind-power business in the United States as well as biofuels installations mainly in Brazil, its solar investments, some of which dated back to the 1980s, were problematic and have largely been closed down, according to the company. In an interview, Dev Sanyal, chief executive of BP’s alternative energy business, said the company had chosen an ill-fated part of the solar business: manufacturing equipment like solar panels, an area now dominated by Asian companies that are better able to compete on price. Lightsource, Mr. Sanyal said, takes a very different approach, focusing on developing and managing solar installations, rather than making the equipment or inventing the technology. The company “is completely agnostic as to what panels it installs,” he said. He added that the attraction of Lightsource, which is privately owned, was that it could be a vehicle for BP to take advantage of what he forecast as 10 percent to 15 percent annual growth in solar power in the coming years. By contrast, demand for oil, which has been growing strongly at around 1.7 percent per annum this year, is expected to eventually level off to less than 1 percent a year through 2040, according to forecasts by the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based organization. The agency attributed that slowing growth in demand to changes like the increasing prevalence of electric vehicles and improving fuel efficiency. BP said its $200 million investment would eventually give it a 43 percent stake in Lightsource, which will be renamed Lightsource BP, and the energy giant will take two seats on the board. BP’s investment will be used to help Lightsource, which has been mainly focused on Britain, grow globally, the companies said. Lightsource develops solar projects and says it thus far has contracts to manage installations that could power about half a million homes. The investment is tiny compared to BP’s capital expenditure of about $16 billion this year. By buying into Lightsource, BP is, in a sense, outsourcing its solar effort. “They need a renewable business to develop over time as part of energy transiting, but were lacking the ability to make solar profitable,” said Oswald Clint, an analyst at Bernstein Research. “Lightsource might be the solution.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/business/energy-environment/bp-lightsource-solar.html,business,The New York Times
689,2018-01-16 05:06:37,2018,1.0,16,Chad Bray,BP to Take $1.7 Billion Charge Over Deepwater Horizon Spill,"LONDON — The energy giant BP said on Tuesday that it expected to take an additional charge of $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter for claims related to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, which killed 11 people and caused the worst oil spill in American history. The company also said that it now anticipated cash payments related to the disaster to be about $3 billion this year, up from an estimate issued in the third quarter of more than $2 billion. “With the claims facility’s work very nearly done, we now have better visibility into the remaining liability,” Brian Gilvary, BP’s chief financial officer, said in a news release. “The charge we are taking as a result is fully manageable within our existing financial framework.” The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig was one of the worst environmental disasters in United States history, spilling millions of gallons of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico. It badly damaged BP’s reputation and has cost the company tens of billions of dollars in fines and settlements. The charge announced on Tuesday is related to a court-supervised settlement program after a class-action lawsuit to resolve claims for business losses and other claims related to the oil spill. The company said this month that it would take a separate noncash charge of about $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter related to a tax overhaul in the United States, but said it expected its future earnings in the United States to be “positively impacted” by the changes, which lowered the corporate income tax rate. The Deepwater Horizon disaster led to a series of new safety regulations for offshore oil drilling, which the Trump administration is preparing to roll back in hopes of generating more domestic energy production. The Interior Department’s Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said in December that the decrease in regulations would reduce “unnecessary burdens” on the energy industry and save the sector $228 million over 10 years. This month, the Trump administration said that it would allow new offshore oil and gas drilling in nearly all United States coastal waters, reversing environmental policies put in place by the Obama administration. Last week, however, the White House backed off opening up more drilling off the coast of Florida after strong opposition from the state’s Republican governor, Rick Scott. Governors in other coastal states have now asked for their own exemptions to the offshore drilling expansion.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/business/dealbook/bp-oil-spill-deepwater-horizon.html,business,The New York Times
690,2018-07-27 11:31:46,2018,7.0,27,Stanley Reed,"BP Makes $10.5 Billion Shale Deal, Its Biggest Since Deepwater Horizon","LONDON — BP has effectively declared that it has recovered from the Gulf of Mexico disaster. The London-based energy giant said late Thursday that it would buy an enormous portfolio covering 470,000 acres of shale oil and gas properties in Texas and Louisiana from BHP Billiton of Australia. The $10.5 billion deal — BP’s biggest in nearly 20 years — signals that the company’s management believes the financial costs of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which have totaled $66 billion, have mostly been paid, leaving it free to contemplate big-ticket acquisitions. The purchase also gives the company a significant foothold in the fast-growing shale industry in the United States, one in which BP had largely been left behind by its major rivals. “BP was aware that they were late on this crucial global resource theme,” said Roy Martin, an analyst at the energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. The agreement with BHP Billiton is BP’s largest since 1999, when it bought Arco, a Los Angeles-based oil company, for $27 billion. Back then, BP was seen as a trendsetter in the global energy industry, snapping up other companies and making an early foray into renewables. It even adopted the slogan “Beyond Petroleum.” The Gulf of Mexico spill changed all that, though, and the company has been considerably more cautious in making major investments since. Beyond its symbolic value, analysts said, the BHP deal is a sign that BP is scrambling to catch up with an industry shift. Shale exploration, which involves drilling long horizontal wells and then injecting fluids, or fracking, to break up rocks beneath the Earth’s surface, had long been carried out by smaller companies. But it has become increasingly attractive to international businesses as oil prices rise and the capacity of the American shale industry increases. Behemoths like Chevron and Exxon Mobil have moved aggressively to extract oil from shale rock. Chevron is ramping up its spending on shale drilling by 50 percent, and it will soon account for almost a third of its overall expenditure on energy output, according to Wood Mackenzie. Exxon Mobil, which is rapidly developing a swath of acreage it bought last year, is also increasing its spending on shale drilling to a similar proportion. By comparison, BP had been spending just 10 percent of its overall drilling expenditure on shale, until it reached the BHP deal. But the sheer size of the deal could catapult the British company to second among large companies when it comes to shale oil output in the United States, Wood Mackenzie said. “Shale is becoming the realm of Big Oil,” said Rob West, a partner at Redburn, an independent financial analysis firm. Mr. West forecasts that the proportion of major oil companies’ output from shale will double by 2025, an increase from about 10 percent of their production now. Part of the attractiveness of investments in shale is the quick payoff. Drilling in shale rock leads to oil extraction much faster than traditional large, and complex, oil and gas investments. That helps reduce a project’s exposure to fluctuations in the price of oil. Those rapid turnarounds are of greater interest to large energy companies, whose boards are increasingly hesitant to approve long-term oil and gas projects. Fearful of declining demand for their products as renewable energy sources like wind and solar become more prevalent, energy executives have been keen to lock in short-term returns on their investments. “The short-term return, which is the story of shale, is building its way into the boardroom,” Andrew F. Gould, a former chief executive of Schlumberger, the oil services giant, said at a conference in Vienna last month. On a call with reporters after the BHP deal was announced, BP executives said the acquisition offered the chance to scale up their shale investments with modest risk. “These are discovered resources in the ground,” said Bernard Looney, BP’s upstream chief executive. “We know they are there.” Uncertainty about the future, and a desire for quick returns on investment, have also driven companies like BP to make deals in areas like solar and wind power, and even for small electric utilities. Total, for instance, recently purchased a utility called Direct Energie for $1.7 billion, while BP struck a $200 million deal for a solar power developer called Lightsource at the end of last year. While these investments remain relatively small in proportion to the companies’ overall spending, analysts say they also offer a quicker payback than oil and gas projects as well as a hedge against an uncertain future for fossil fuels.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/27/business/energy-environment/bp-bhp-shale-oil-gas.html,business,The New York Times
691,2019-08-01 00:00:00,2019,8.0,1,CNN Business,BP and China's Didi are building an electric car charging network,"London (CNN Business)BP has teamed up with ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing to build a network of charging points across China, the world's largest market for electric vehicles. The companies said the new standalone charging stations will be made available for use by Didi drivers and the general public. The joint venture could soon expand to include services for vehicle fleets. BP (BP) and Didi already operate a test site in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou with 10 charging stations. The financial terms of the joint venture were not disclosed. The companies said in a statement that they aim to ""quickly become the leading electric vehicle charging provider in China."" Didi has roughly 550 million users on its platform, and around 600,000 electric vehicles are running on it in China. Earlier this year it joined forces with China's State Grid to connect its drivers with the giant power utility's 50,000 charging stations.  BP is already rolling out a network of charging stations in its home UK market. ""The lessons we learn [in China] will help us further expand BP's advanced mobility business worldwide, helping drive the energy transition and develop solutions for a low carbon world,"" said BP executive Tufan Erginbilgic. A lack of charging infrastructure is one of the main barriers to the mass adoption of electric vehicles. The shift to electric is already underway in China, however. Roughly half of all electric cars are sold in the country, where tough regulation and government incentives have driven demand.  BP said the Chinese government wants 4.8 million charging points installed across the country by next year, up from 770,000 at present. General Motors (GM), America's largest automaker, and Bechtel, the country's largest construction company, said in May they would build thousands of fast-charging stations across the United States. GM will provide the data and expertise needed to place chargers in the locations where they can best be used. Bechtel, meanwhile, will provide expertise in engineering, building and permitting for the stations. ",https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/01/tech/bp-didi-china-charging-network/index.html,tech,CNN

The deal, which includes interests in the most prolific oil field in U.S. history at Prudhoe Bay, and the 800-mile (1,300-km) Trans Alaska Pipeline, is part of BP’s plan to raise $10 billion over the next two years through asset sales to further strengthen its balance sheet, it said. For years, BP has been reducing its role in Alaska, where oil production has fallen with declines at the Prudhoe Bay field. BP, which began working in Alaska in 1959, is the operator and holds a 26% stake in Prudhoe, where production began in 1977. In 2014, BP sold Hilcorp half its share of an Alaskan project. This year, the two were due to decide whether to go ahead with an ambitious $1.5 billion offshore project that requires construction of a man-made island. The acquisition fits Hilcorp’s historical strategy of acquiring mature fields from major oil companies and slashing costs. The company, founded in 1990 by Texas oilman Jeffery Hildebrand, has operations across the United States. Hilcorp spokespeople did not reply to requests for comment. “This deal vaults Hilcorp to be the second-largest Alaska producer and reserves holder, behind only ConocoPhillips,” said Rowena Gunn, a Wood Mackenzie energy analyst. Hilcorp must show it can maintain output at Prudhoe Bay, where BP has been the operator, she said. Prudhoe has to date produced over 13 billion barrels of oil and is estimated to have the potential to produce more than one billion further barrels. BP’s net oil production from Alaska in 2019 is expected to average almost 74,000 barrels per day. The deal calls for a $4 billion initial payment to BP with the remaining $1.6 billion in earnout payments over time. “We are steadily reshaping BP and today we have other opportunities, both in the U.S. and around the world, that are more closely aligned with our long-term strategy and more competitive for our investment,” BP Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said. The Alaska sale pushes BP closer to its goal of selling $10 billion of properties following the 2018 acquisition of BHP’s U.S. shale assets, a $10.5 billion deal that catapulted the London-based company into a major Texas shale producer. BP previously had said that most of the disposals would come from its shale assets, particularly natural gas fields. The sale would help BP reduce its debt, which rose to 31% of its market capitalization by the end of June. The sale faces regulatory approvals, including by the state of Alaska. State Senate Minority Leader Tom Begich said he expects the legislature to hold hearings and review Hilcorp’s environmental and safety record, which included a natural gas pipeline leak in Alaska’s Cook Inlet that lasted for months in the winter of 2016-17. “I want to make sure they’re not just pumping hard and walking away,” said Begich. “I don’t want to be left with a mess to clean up.” The divestment comes months after BP agreed to sell its interests in the Gulf of Suez oil concessions in Egypt to Dubai-based Dragon Oil for an undisclosed sum. It also has sought to sell U.S. shale assets in Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma and Wyoming. BP said about 1,600 employees are currently part of its Alaskan business, adding that it was “committed to providing clarity about their future as soon as possible as part of the transition process with Hilcorp.” Reporting by Ron Bousso, Jennifer Hiller in Houston, Tanishaa Nadkar and Muvija M in Bengaluru, and Yereth Rosen in Anchorage; Editing by Gary McWilliams, Marguerita Choy and Richard Pullin",https://www.reuters.com/article/bp-divestiture/update-3-bp-to-quit-alaska-after-60-years-with-56-bln-sale-to-hilcorp-idUSL3N25N3SR,Business News,Reuters

Why it matters: Hints of the answer will come when the Interior Department sells leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as soon as this year, after a 2017 GOP tax bill opened the region following decades of political battles. It could hold over 10 billion barrels of oil in a state where the oil industry is a large part of its economic well-being. But, environmentalists strongly oppose drilling in the ecologically sensitive region. The big question: While BP has signaled that it's done with Alaska, it's unclear how many other companies will look to buy leases in ANWR. Either way, any actual production would likely be at least a decade off. The big picture: The state has lots of oil in other areas of the North Slope, including the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A), which is one of the places where the state's biggest producer ConocoPhillips has acreage. But oil companies, especially giants with deep pockets like BP, have cheaper alternatives in the lower-48 at a time of modest oil prices and uncertain future demand. What they're saying: Axios spoke with IHS Markit analyst Kareemah Mohamed about the wildlife refuge and the wider future of Alaskan crude. ANWR ""would appeal to companies who are comfortable with that type of frontier exploration risk and also companies who know the Alaska north slope really well,"" she says. One example is Hilcorp, already a big player in Alaska even before its deal this week with BP. But the majors face shareholder pressure on the environment and pledges to slow emissions — a poor fit with frontier Alaskan development. ""While they are the ones who are capable of absorbing exploration risk on that scale, I am not sure they would be the ones to expand their presence at this time,"" she says. Turning to the future of Alaska overall, she doesn't expect a return to the ""golden years"" of huge output. But, that said, ""My outlook generally isn’t negative on the North Slope."" She notes Alaska offers large resources, existing data and infrastructure that enables shorter cycle and less capital-intensive opportunities. The bottom line: ""We would expect to see stable production for the next decade or so,"" she says. After that, it's impossible to say.

The sale, which must be approved by state and federal regulators, comes as BP attempts to divest $10 billion in assets by 2020. ""Energy is a cornerstone of the Alaskan economy and this investment will help drive growth in local energy production, jobs and state and local revenue for many years to come,"" Jason Rebrook, president of Hilcorp Energy, said in a release. ""Hilcorp has a proven track record of bringing new life to mature basins, including Alaska's Cook Inlet and the North Slope, and we have a clear understanding that an experienced local workforce is critical to success."" BP's history in Alaska dates to 1959, and the British company drilled the confirmation well for the Prudhoe Bay field in 1968. Prudhoe Bay, the most prolific oil field in U.S. history, has produced more than 13 billion barrels of oil. Production has been in a steady decline since the late 1980s. ""We are steadily reshaping BP and today we have other opportunities, both in the U.S. and around the world, that are more closely aligned with our long-term strategy and more competitive for our investment,"" BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley said in the release. ""This transaction also underpins our two-year $10 billion divestment program, further strengthening our balance sheet and enabling us to pursue new advantaged opportunities for BP's portfolio within our disciplined financial framework,"" he said. Under terms of the agreement, Hilcorp will pay $4 billion in the near-term and $1.6 billion later. BP employs about 1,600 workers in Alaska. ""BP is committed to providing clarity about their future as soon as possible as part of the transition process with Hilcorp,"" the release said.

The strategy, outlined in a Reuters interview with company executives, follows BP’s move to acquire giant miner BHP’s (BHP.AX) assets in the United States’ prolific Permian shale basin last year, expected to give its portfolio a boost in light-sweet crude production. “This (Asia) is a key growth region” for energy demand, said Sharon Weintraub, BP’s chief executive officer of supply and trading for the eastern hemisphere. She didn’t specify BP’s growth targets for Asia sales. “We recently bought BHP’s assets in our U.S. business so we have a greater amount of Permian crude coming to market over the next few years in terms of our equity portfolio,” Weintraub said. Zoe Anderson, head of analytics at the supply and trading, eastern hemisphere business, said, “The idea is, yes, we want to send (U.S. crude) supply here (Asia).” BP has been actively shipping U.S. crude to Asia, having sold cargoes to Japan, Australia, Thailand and Vietnam as it jostles for business in the world’s fastest-growing market with other giant producers and traders like Occidental (OXY.N), Trafigura, Royal Dutch Shell(RDSa.L), Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), Chevron (CVX.N) and Aramco Trading Co. BP ships a variety of light crudes to Asia, such as West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Midland and Eagle Ford, and medium-sour grades Mars and Thunder Horse. More U.S. crude is being processed by refineries across Asia. It’s replacing falling regional low-sulfur crude production, and some of the world’s top crude oil importers, like South Korea and India, are expanding imports this year to replace sanctions-hit Iranian oil. Sanctions on Venezuela, as well as Iran, have kept crude supplies in Asia snug, supporting Brent LCOc1 at $60 a barrel. But new supplies of refined products, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and petrochemicals have hit the market just as trade tensions between the United States and China dent demand, weighing on prices this year. “With a lack of confidence affecting things like trade flows that’s going to extend downside risks in the short run till we see some resolution, which is still unclear when that’s going to happen,” Weintraub said. BP is also expecting new LNG supplies from Indonesia, Africa and the United States to come online in early next decade, Weintraub said, a period where some analysts expect the market to tighten. These supplies include BP’s share of production in the Greater Tortue development offshore Senegal and Mauritania, Venture Global’s Calcasieu Pass project in the United States, and Indonesia’s Tangguh phase 3 expansion. “LNG is a cyclical market and it happens to be on the weaker side today, and we do expect demand to potentially right-size itself,” Weintraub said. Longer term, Asia also features in BP’s plans to cope with a gradual global shift away from oil and into cleaner energy sources. BP said last month it would build a network of electric-vehicle charging hubs in China with Didi Chuxing, the country’s biggest ride-hailing company, in a bet on the world’s largest market for such cars.

708,2019-09-10 00:00:00,2019,9.0,10,"Ron Bousso, Matthew Green",BP unveils measures to battle methane leaks,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP is introducing continuous monitoring of methane leaks at new oil and gas projects using drones and surveillance cameras, in a bid to cut emissions of the potent greenhouse gas to near zero. The technology, which could encompass BP’s entire output within a decade or so, comes as the oil and gas industry faces mounting pressure from investors and activists to cut heat-trapping emissions to meet 2015 Paris Climate Agreement goals. In what it said was an industry first, London-based BP said methane detecting and measurement technologies will be deployed at all its new projects globally to cut the volume of methane production it loses as emissions to below its current target of 0.2%. Methane, the primary component of natural gas, leaks from oil and gas wells, pipelines and processing facilities. It has more than 80 times the heat-trapping potential of carbon dioxide in the first 20 years after it escapes into the atmosphere. The oil and gas sector’s methane emissions reached 80 million tonnes in 2017, roughly 6% of the sector’s global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the International Energy Agency. Methane emissions “remain high despite initial industry-led initiatives and government policies announced recently. Implementing abatement options quickly and at scale remains a real challenge,” IEA analyst Christophe McGlade said. The Trump administration is weighing rescinding Obama-era limits on oil and gas industry methane emissions, a move that sparked a backlash among environmentalists, institutional investors and some oil companies. In 2017 and 2018 BP’s methane emissions were slightly below the 0.2% target set in 2016 and should hold beneath that level this year, Gordon Birrell, BP chief operating officer for upstream, told Reuters in an interview. The company said this year it would improve disclosure around emissions and show how its investments meet the Paris climate goal to limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius. Analysts claim that some of its investments since 2018 were not in line with the Paris goals. Oil companies have traditionally measured methane escapes through calculations and estimates. The use of infrared cameras mounted on robots, drones or located on site allows constant monitoring, detection and measurements of leaks with much higher precision, Birrell said. “Technology is the key in my view to emissions reduction. We see lots of opportunity for the use of technology to reduce methane and other emissions and get all the benefit of natural gas,” he said. Funding for the project will come from the $1.5 billion BP has earmarked for maintaining assets. BP recently launched a drone from the Shetland Islands in northern Scotland to detect and measure methane emissions from its Clair platform, located nearly 100 km offshore. “Remote facilities can be monitored from very close up,” Birrell said. “It is quite a game-changer in terms of methane detection.” BP will also deploy the technologies at a number of existing production facilities, including in Oman and Azerbaijan.

722,2019-09-26 00:00:00,2019,9.0,26,Amy Harder,BP CEO: Best to stay in trade groups for climate policy influence,"BP chief executive Bob Dudley has indicated that his company is likely to stay in industry trade groups despite differences in positions on climate policy.  What they’re saying: ""BP believes that you can influence trade associations and other groups by being a part of them rather than outside of them,"" Dudley told Axios on the sidelines of a climate-change event in New York this week. Driving the news:  BP is conducting a review of its membership in trade groups and will report back to shareholders in 2020, BP Chairman Helge Lund said earlier this year. Dudley didn't comment on the ongoing review, but his remarks hint that the oil giant isn't likely to part company with the K Street establishment despite differences.  Where it stands: Facing public, investor and legal pressure, oil companies are increasingly backing action on the issue of climate change while still remaining members of trade associations whose positions don’t align with that shift. Royal Dutch Shell, another major oil and gas producer based in Europe, left earlier this year the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, which represents oil and gas refining interests, due to differences over climate policy. ExxonMobil is opting to stay in groups like AFPM to try to influence them on climate change, an official said this summer.  Virtually all oil companies have opted to stay in the American Petroleum Institute, the broadest oil trade group that also sets standards across the sector in addition to its lobbying activities.   One level deeper: Dudley, like the Exxon, said trade groups provide more than one purpose, so it’s beneficial to stay involved despite differences. ""I respect Shell’s position,"" Dudley said about that company’s moves. ""I think collaboration inside organizations is a better track. It doesn’t always work. We’ve left associations in the past.""  A high-profile example is when BP left the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council in 2015. That group has lost several corporate members in recent years due to its position doubting established climate-change science.",https://www.axios.com/bp-trade-groups-climate-policy-influence-1b9f09e9-2cc8-48b0-9989-a285810429d5.html,,Axios
723,2019-09-30 00:00:00,2019,9.0,30,Ben Geman,Reports: BP CEO prepared to head for the exit,"BP CEO Bob Dudley is preparing to leave the oil-and-gas giant within roughly a year, which would end a decade-long run at the helm, according to Sky News and Reuters. Why it matters: The plan, if true, is part of a wider changing of the guard at some of the world's largest oil companies.  Exxon CEO Darren Woods took over for Rex Tillerson in 2017 after Tillerson left for what would be a short tenure as secretary of state. Mike Wirth became CEO of Chevron in 2018, replacing John Watson. Where it stands: Sky News reported Saturday that Dudley is preparing to leave ""within about 12 months,"" while Reuters noted Monday that he's ""drawing up plans"" to step down next year.  BP did not confirm that the 64-year-old Dudley is preparing to step down. A spokesman tells Axios that ""we don't comment on speculation."" The big picture: Dudley became CEO months after the fatal 2010 Gulf of Mexico blowout and massive spill of over 3 million barrels that wreaked havoc on BP's finances and reputation.  A big part of his tenure has focused on steering the company through the years of aftermath, including sale of tens of billions of dollars of assets.  BP has paid over $65 billion in costs for cleanup, settlements, penalties, restoration efforts and more. Dudley has also overseen repositioning of the company in other ways. They include... Recently boosting its position in U.S. shale with the $10.5 billion purchase of BHP's assets in 2018, and August's announcement that BP is exiting Alaska after a decades-long run as a huge player in the state. Expanding BP's moves to diversify into other energy sources, although oil-and-gas are still the overwhelming majority of its business. Examples include BP's purchase last year of U.K. electric vehicle charging network Chargemaster and investment in the fast-charging startup StoreDot. BP has also revived its solar efforts with purchase of a 43% stake in the solar developer Lightsource (now called Lightsource BP) rolled out in late 2017. Where it stands: ""Mr. Dudley is under no pressure to step down, meaning a lengthy handover to his successor is possible and could take place after he has turned 65,"" Sky reports.",https://www.axios.com/bp-ceo-bob-dudley-retirement-458f34c7-2ccd-46e1-a265-2e71f63c0f75.html,,Axios
724,2019-09-24 00:00:00,2019,9.0,24,Amy Harder,"BP CEO: ""Remarkable"" that prices stabilized so fast after Saudi oil attack","Following the Sept. 14 attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities, BP CEO Bob Dudley said he found it a ""remarkable thing that the oil market settled down so quickly.""  Why it matters: His comments, made to Axios in an interview Monday in New York, are the latest sign of how much has changed in the global oil industry over the last few years partly as a result of America's booming oil production.  Where things stand: The Sept. 14 attack on Saudi Arabian oil infrastructure knocked out 5.7 million barrels, more than half of the country's entire daily production and roughly 5% of the world’s daily production.  That led to a nearly 20% spike in oil prices on Sept. 15, the biggest jump in history. Gasoline prices, which are largely determined by global oil prices, have spiked in more than half the U.S. But oil prices quickly dropped and have stabilized since the historic jump last week to hover around $60 a barrel. Pump prices, which rose a dime after the attacks to $2.66 a gallon, have also stabilized, according to AAA. What they’re saying: I asked Dudley if he thought the oil market was adequately pricing in geopolitical tension in the Middle East.  “It’s a good question because markets usually get it right broadly,” said Dudley, who went on to cite the “resiliency” of Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil company, and other production and storage around the world. “Tensions still remain, but I think it will play out over months and months here. I can’t fault the market.” The big picture: Dudley’s reaction to the oil market news came before he and other CEOs of global oil and gas companies met in New York Monday to talk about a markedly different kind of risk the industry faces: the existential threat of climate change. The industry is facing growing pressure from investors, politicians and the public to offer solutions to a problem they are helping fuel.

727,2019-10-04 00:00:00,2019,10.0,4,,NEWSMAKER-Dudley's decade at the helm of BP almost didn't happen,"LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley's decade at the helm of one of the world's biggest oil companies almost didn't happen. Dropped into the role in 2010 after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster, 11 rig workers had just died and the company's finances were teetering. Dudley had lived in Mississippi in his youth and spent his holidays fishing on the Gulf. He was now put in charge of cleaning up the biggest environmental disaster in U.S. history in those very waters. As BP scrambled to contain a crisis that threatened to take down a company after more than 100 years of operation, investors were running scared. Its market valued halved in two months as the scale of the disaster unfolded. Dudley received an early morning phone call that marked what would be the ""worst moment"", he told Reuters in an interview last year. ""When I heard that our debt was untradable back in the summer of 2010... To me that was a moment of the unthinkable was possible."" The feared collapse of BP did not come, but the onslaught did, with BP facing clean-up costs and lawsuits that would eventually top a staggering $75 billion. Dudley needed to sell oil and gas assets to find the money and so the sell-off began, with BP eventually doing deals worth over $60 billion, including selling prized assets such as its Texas City refinery, Gulf of Mexico oilfields and Russian joint venture. He shrank BP, but the drastic diet left Dudley in charge of a company fitter than some of rivals when the next challenge hit in the form of 2014's collapse in oil prices. The slide would roll into early 2016, with Brent crude oil prices falling more than 70% to levels not seen since 2003 and companies reeling to cut costs. EARLY YEARS Born in New York, Dudley grew up in Mississippi and later moved to Illinois where he attended university. He entered the oil world in 1979 when joining U.S. firm Amoco, where he held a number of roles including working in Russia before BP took over the company in 1998 and retained his services. His Russian experience helped Dudley win the top job at BP's Russian joint venture TNK-BP venture in 2003. Five years later Dudley made global headlines as he fled Russia fearing for his life after falling out with Russian oligarchs who accused Dudley of favouritism towards BP employees. Dudley in turn accused the oligarchs of using the Kremlin and other Russian authorities to help settle purely commercial disputes. Despite the clash, Dudley's composed managerial style would again shine through as he later became one of the Kremlin's closest Western business allies. BP and the oligarchs would later sell TNK-BP to Russian oil producer Rosneft for over $50 billion. A quarter of BP's oil production now originates from Russia. In March, Dudley helped organise a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and top UK businesses in a bid to smooth relations damaged by the poisoning in Britain of former double agent Sergei Skripal, for which Britain blames Russia. ""He has led BP in a very wise, calm way over the last decade,"" BP Chairman Helge Lund told Reuters in an interview in June. UNFINISHED BUSINESS Dudley oversaw not only BP's recovery from near collapse in 2010 but its rebound from the 2014 oil crisis. But he leaves with one major unfinished task, namely, BP's transition to greener energy and lower emissions. Although BP has agreed to set targets to reduce some of its carbon emissions and increase spending on renewables, critics say under Dudley BP has done too little to reduce carbon emissions and increase investment in renewable energy. Instead, it has posted its fastest expansion in oil and gas production in decades, rising some 20% since 2016. ""From the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster to the climate emergency, Bob Dudley's tenure as BP's boss has been a failure,"" said John Sauven, executive director at Greenpeace UK. ""These valuable years should have been used to end the expansion of fossil fuels."" Shareholders have also expressed criticism, rejecting his pay package in 2016 and forcing BP to cut it by 40%. Dudley, who turns 65 next September, will step down in February to make way for successor Bernard Looney, BP's current head of upstream operations.

BP's incoming CEO tasked with navigating energy transition,"BP upstream chief executive Bernard Looney will take the reins from CEO Bob Dudley early next year, with investors eager to understand what this means for the FTSE 100 giant. The U.K.-based oil and gas major announced Friday that Dudley, who has worked with BP for 40 years and held the position of CEO for almost a decade, will be replaced by Looney on February 5, 2020.In a press release, BP Chairman Helge Lund said that it was a logical time to make the announcement ""as the company charts its course through the energy transition."" Dudley, who is 64 years old, has decided to step down after the delivery of the firm's 2019 full-year results on February 4, 2020. He will then retire on March 31 later that year. Looney, 49, will continue with his current role until February 5, at which point he will take the reins from Dudley and join the BP board. ""I think one thing that has really marked Bernard's tenure as the head of upstream is a move towards digitalization and he has also had a very strong focus on cost control,"" Jason Gammel, senior oil and gas analyst at Jefferies, told CNBC's ""Street Signs"" on Friday. ""So, those are things that are evolutionary in some respects. But digitalization for the industry could be revolutionary as well."" Gammel said that while Dudley's legacy has been ""absolutely outstanding,"" Looney's track record made him a ""great"" choice to become CEO of the energy giant next year. Shares of BP had risen by more than 1% by early Friday afternoon. Looney has run BP's upstream business since April 2016 and has been a member of the firm's executive management team since November 2010. The upstream division includes 17,000 people operating across almost 30 countries and produces around 2.6 million barrels equivalent of oil and gas a day. An Irish citizen, Looney joined BP in 1991 as a drilling engineer and worked in operational roles in the North Sea, Vietnam and the Gulf of Mexico. Former WPP CEO Martin Sorrell told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Friday that Looney is likely to find making his mark at BP more difficult than when Dudley first took charge in 2010. That's because Looney is ""taking it over at a time when things are in relatively better shape."" Sorrell added that Looney would likely be forced to take his time in revising BP's traditional operation. ""The trend is towards transforming at relatively low speeds and I think that's the big issue that all companies face in digital transformation,"" he said. ""You have to take big hits because if you're trying to restructure a legacy operation which has outlived its purpose and is not for purpose, you have to make legacy cuts and you have to take hits to the balance sheet that shareholders are often unwilling to take."" Dudley took over as CEO of BP on October 1, 2010 in the wake of the biggest oil spill in U.S. history. The Deepwater Horizon catastrophe killed 11 people and threatened the company's existence. His job was to try to restore the company to a position it held before the explosion, managing the company's balance sheet as it faced billions of dollars' worth of penalties and clean-up costs. More recently, BP agreed to a request from shareholders in May for greater detail and transparency on how each capital investment decision would align with the Paris climate agreement — an international accord that seeks to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius. Last month, Dudley said BP would sell some of its most carbon-intensive projects and reduce investment in others to try to improve the firm's environmental footprint. The energy giant has been targeted by climate activist groups on numerous occasions in recent months, with demonstrators increasingly angry about the lack of progress toward a lower-carbon future. ""The new CEO has an opportunity to turn the page on years of denial, inaction and prevarication,"" John Sauven, executive director at Greenpeace U.K. told CNBC via email. ""BP should now pivot away from fossil fuels, shift to renewable energy and support a just transition for its workers,"" Sauven said. Greenpeace has urged BP to end exploration projects for new oil and gas and switch to investing only in renewable energy. In an apparent reference to Greenpeace's demands when speaking to CNBC earlier this year, Dudley said: ""The reality is it is going to take all forms of energy to solve this. One of the groups wants us to go 100% into renewables (but) it has got to be a race to reduce emissions not a race to renewables.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/04/evolution-or-revolution-bps-incoming-ceo-tasked-with-navigating-energy-transition.html,Energy,CNBC

736,2019-10-10 00:00:00,2019,10.0,10,"Gram Slattery, Marta Nogueira","BP, Shell among bidders in $800 million Brazilian oil auction","RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 10 (Reuters) - BP PLC, Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell PLC are among firms that will compete for exploration and production rights off the Brazilian coast on Thursday, in the first of three oil bidding rounds scheduled for coming weeks. Combined, the minimum signing bonuses for the blocks in the so-called 16th post-salt oil bidding round in the Latin American oil powerhouse come to roughly $800 million. That is significant by historical standards, but pales in comparison to Brazil’s so-called transfer-of-rights bidding round and 6th pre-salt round, both scheduled for early November. Those rounds are expected to bring around $25 billion and $2 billion into government coffers, respectively. The post-salt blocks are less prolific than the pre-salt blocks, where billions of barrels of oil are trapped beneath a thick layer of salt beneath ocean floor. Still, there are some prized areas in the 16th round, particularly in the Campos and Santos Basins off the coast of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. One block in particular, the C-M-541 in the Campos Basin, has a minimum signing bonus of roughly 1.375 billion reais ($335 million) and directly borders the pre-salt region. Seven relatively minor blocks off the northeastern state of Bahia are the subject of environmental litigation by federal prosecutors, authorities said on Wednesday, casting judicial uncertainty over parts of the auction. Authorities and environmentalists are concerned that the seven blocks in question, which have a combined signing bonus of roughly $16 million, are located too close to the ecologically significant Abrolhos archipelago. Ecopetrol SA, Karoon Energy Ltd, Qatar Petroleum, Equinor ASA, Total SA, China National Offshore Oil Corp Ltd, Repsol SA, Murphy Oil Corp, Petrogal, Petronas and Wintershall Dea GmbH are also registered to participate in the bidding. Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA, known as Petrobras, and Enauta Participacoes SA are also eligible to bid. Karoon, Shell, Enauta, Ecopetrol and Petrobras declined to comment on the bidding round. All other companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reporting by Gram Slattery and Marta Nogueira; editing by

In a statement, London-based BP said it expects to agree asset sales of $10 billion by end-year after its $5.6 billion sale of its Alaskan business to Hilcorp [HILCO.UL] and divestments in U.S. shale gas. BP shares were down 1.1% by 0948 GMT compared with a 1.3% gain in the broader European energy index.

The planned third-quarter impairment charges are expected to increase BP’s gearing - the ratio between debt and market capitalization - to the top end of the 20% to 30% target, BP said. Debt levels and gearing are expected to move to the middle of the range through 2020. BP’s third-quarter oil and gas production will be impacted by maintenance in some high-margin regions, BP said.

740,2019-10-04,2019,10.0,4,Ben Geman,BP says Bernard Looney will succeed Bob Dudley as its next CEO,"BP said Friday that Bernard Looney, head of the company's oil-and-gas exploration and production unit, will take over as CEO in early February. Why it matters: It adds clarity to the oil giant's succession plans after word emerged recently that current CEO Bob Dudley, 64, is readying to step down after a decade in the role. Where it stands: The 49-year-old Looney joined BP as an engineer in 1991 and moved through several roles, becoming head of the upstream division in 2016. Per Reuters, ""The Irishman's energetic management style was quickly felt as he spearheaded BP's drive to improve performance through cost cutting and digitalization."" He's been the upstream chief at an active time that included the $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP's U.S. shale assets and BP's recently announced sale of its Alaska operations. The big picture: As I noted in this piece about Dudley's career, it's part of a wider changing of the guard at some of the world's largest oil companies. ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods took over for Rex Tillerson in 2017 after Tillerson left for what would be a short tenure as secretary of state. Mike Wirth became CEO of Chevron in 2018, replacing John Watson. One big question: How Looney will address growing pressure on oil-and-gas giants to take more aggressive steps on climate change. Under Dudley, BP has set emissions-cutting targets for its operations and boosted investments in renewables, electric vehicle charging and other climate-friendly tech. However, alternative energy remains a small share of its business. And BP has rejected activists' calls to set targets for emissions-cutting from use of its fuels in the economy (known as ""scope 3"" emissions). What they're saying: BP Chairman Helge Lund, in a statement praising Dudley's tenure, said of Looney: ""As the company charts its course through the energy transition this is a logical time for a change.""

Why it matters: It's the latest sign of how oil majors are boosting their investments in power technologies, EV charging and other areas outside their dominant fossil fuel lines. The big picture: BP and Grid Edge said in their joint announcement that the startup's tech draws on data like weather forecasts and expected building occupancy to help customers tailor their energy needs. It enables them to ""leverage periods of high renewable power generation, and effectively use their building’s flexibility in energy demand and generation like a giant battery, to reduce costs and carbon emissions,"" per the statement. The companies did not disclose the size of the investment. Speaking of Big Oil and climate change, Reuters reports: ""Royal Dutch Shell said on Thursday it would offset the carbon dioxide emissions of around 1.5 million road users in Britain starting later this month under a loyalty scheme.""

742,2019-10-09 00:00:00,2019,10.0,9,,BP CEO Bob Dudley: Bloomberg's $500 million plan irresponsible,"Outgoing BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley believes Michael Bloomberg's $500 million plan to halt the building of gas-fired power plants in the U.S. is ""irresponsible."" Speaking to CNBC's Steve Sedgwick at the Oil & Money conference in London Wednesday, Dudley said: ""Every scenario I look at, we cannot carpet the world with renewables fast enough."" In June, Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, said that he would donate $500 million to a co-ordinated campaign called ""Beyond Carbon."" The campaign, according to its website, is designed to get the U.S. ""on the path to a 100% clean energy economy."" In doing so, it plans to prevent the growth of natural gas and close every coal-fired power plant in the U.S. In a separate speech to those in attendance at the Oil & Money conference, Dudley said that while Bloomberg's efforts ""may be well intentioned,"" they were also ""misguided."" ""They rest on a false equivalence between gas and coal. And an assumption that an all-electric economy will emerge just as soon as we close the alternatives,"" Dudley said. When asked by CNBC why he referenced Bloomberg in his speech, Dudley replied: ""Because I think it is irresponsible."" ""I think it means well (but) it is not going to work in so many countries."" A spokesperson for Michael Bloomberg was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC Wednesday afternoon. Last week, the U.K.-based oil and gas major announced Dudley would step down from his current role at the end of March next year. The 64-year-old has worked with BP for 40 years and held the position of chief executive for almost a decade. He will be replaced by current upstream chief executive, Bernard Looney, shortly after delivering the firm's full-year results in early February next year. Looney, 49, will continue with his current role until February 5, at which point he will take the reins from Dudley and join the BP board. The energy giant has been targeted by climate activist groups on numerous occasions in recent months, with demonstrators increasingly angry about the lack of progress toward a lower-carbon future. Earlier this year, BP agreed to a request from shareholders for greater detail and transparency on how each capital investment decision would align with the Paris climate agreement — an international accord that seeks to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius. Dudley said last month that BP would sell some of its most carbon-intensive projects and reduce investment in others to try to improve the firm's environmental footprint.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/09/bp-ceo-bob-dudley-bloombergs-500-million-plan-irresponsible.html,Oil and Gas,CNBC
743,2019-10-04 03:58:36,2019,10.0,4,Stanley Reed,BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley Is to Retire,"Mr. Dudley was credited with steadying the oil company after a deadly blowout in the Gulf of Mexico. Bernard Looney will replace him in February. LONDON — Bob Dudley, the chief executive of BP, will retire in February after nearly a decade in the job, the oil company announced Friday. The company’s chairman, Helge Lund, said in a statement that the move came at a “logical time for a change,” with BP charting its course through a global “energy transition.” Concerns about climate change are growing, and BP and other energy companies are under pressure from investors, environmentalists and governments — especially in Europe — to reduce the carbon emissions for both its operations and its products. Bernard Looney, a longtime company insider who runs the crucial business of finding and developing oil and gas, was named as Mr. Dudley’s replacement. Mr. Dudley, 64, became chief executive in 2010, succeeding Tony Hayward after the blowout of a well in the Gulf of Mexico killed 11 people and caused a large oil spill. Mr. Dudley, the first American to lead BP, was widely credited with stabilizing the London-based oil giant when its existence was threatened. The company has largely recovered from the effects of the disaster in the gulf and has resumed making large investments in new oil and gas projects and acquisitions. Mr. Looney, 49, comes from a traditional background for a chief executive of BP, which is known for finding and developing troves of oil and gas. He joined BP in 1991 as a drilling engineer and worked in the North Sea, Vietnam and the Gulf of Mexico, including on the Thunder Horse field, a high-profile project. He also worked as an executive assistant to Mr. Hayward and his immediate predecessor, John Browne. These roles often lead to advancement at BP. Mr. Looney has headed BP’s upstream business, which explores for oil and gas and extracts it for sale to world markets, since 2016. According to BP, he recently clinched the deals to sell the company’s long-held oil fields in Alaska for $5.6 billion and to acquire the United States shale drilling assets of BHP Billiton last year for $10.5 billion. Mr. Looney, who is Irish, has been pushing for internal changes at BP, including the greater use of technology to drill for and extract oil. He may find himself with as challenging a mission as Mr. Dudley faced. Although BP was reeling from the Gulf of Mexico disaster, the future of oil and gas companies looked robust a decade ago. When Mr. Dudley started at BP, it looked as if “demand would go to the sky,” said Oswald Clint, an analyst at Bernstein, a market research firm. Now, Mr. Clint said, with climate change as an imperative to consider other energy sources, the outlook for BP’s products is “opaque.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/business/bp-ceo-bob-dudley-bernard-looney.html,business,The New York Times

Dragon, owned by Emirates National Oil Company (ENOC), said it had replaced BP as the partner of state-owned Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) in the Gulf of Suez Petroleum Company (GUPCO), which has 11 offshore oil exploration and production concessions. GUPCO’s target had been to increase the concessions’ combined production to 75,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil by 2021 from the current 60,000 bpd. But Dragon said it plans to boost production to above 75,000 bpd and maintain this level for 10 years by further drilling and investing $1 billion over the next five years.

The unauthorized stunt at the National Portrait Gallery capped a two-week wave of actions by civil disobedience movement Extinction Rebellion, which led to more than 3,300 arrests in London and cities around the world, the group said. Activists spread a white sheet over the floor of the main hall of the gallery’s Ondaatje wing before two women and a man wearing only skin-colored underwear adopted foetal positions on the covering. Protesters then slowly doused the prone performers with washable black liquid as activist Eden Rickson read a poem asking the gallery to stop accepting sponsorship money from BP. “We cannot be artists on a dead planet...Yet right now the National Portrait Gallery is tied to a company brutally funding the end of our world,” Rickson said. “With compassion, we ask you to change. Oil means the end, but art means the beginning.” The National Portrait Gallery said BP’s support for its Portrait Award encouraged the work of artists around the world and enabled free admission to an exhibition, which had drawn more than 300,000 visitors this year. “The ongoing debate around BP’s sponsorship of the arts raises important questions about both the environment and arts funding, and we are listening carefully to voices on all sides,” the gallery said in a statement.

The planned production site for acetic acid, which is used in chemical products such as paints and adhesives, would be part of ZPCC’s refining and petrochemical plant in Zhoushan in eastern China, BP said in a statement. “The potential new plant...would be BP’s largest acetic acid producing site in the world. China is the world’s largest acetic acid market and accounts for more than half of global production capacity,” BP added. BP plans to sell more U.S. crude to Asia as its shale oil production grows, seeking to capitalize on growth in the world’s key demand region. In recent months, the British group deepened its ties with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries by forging a fuel retailing joint venture to capitalize on rising demand in Asia’s third-biggest economy. BP has also said it would build a network of charging hubs for electric vehicles with China’s Didi Chuxing, betting on the world’s largest market for such cars. ZPCC is a mixed-ownership joint-venture company with private holdings and state-owned enterprises, BP said. A PetroChina unit has won a license to supply marine bunker fuel in Zhoushan on China’s east coast, as the city’s free trade zone looks to challenge Singapore as a regional shipping fuel hub, according to a company executive and local government official.

Daily output fell to 146,100 barrels of oil equivalents per day (boepd) in the July-September quarter period from 150,600 boepd a year earlier and was short of a target of around 158,700 boepd announced in April. Aker BP blamed the fall on a delay in starting new wells at the North Sea Valhall field following maintenance in June, adding there was no impact on reserves. The Oslo-listed firm, 30% owned by BP Plc (BP.L) and 40% by Norway’s Aker ASA (AKER.OL), also said it would book an goodwill impairment charge of $80 million and would see an additional $14 million in costs stemming from repair work at one of its North Sea fields. As the goodwill cost incurred is not deductible under Norway’s tax code, Aker BP’s tax bill for the third quarter will be “well above” 100% of its profits, the company said. However, the start-up of the new wells at Valhall, and the ramp-up of the giant Johan Sverdrup oilfield which started production in October will significantly boost output going forward, it said. Aker BP has a 11.6% stake in the Sverdrup field, which is expected to ramp up production to 440,000 boepd by summer 2020, its operator Equinox (EQNR.OL) has said.

The company, jointly controlled by oil major BP Plc (BP.L) and Norwegian holding company Aker ASA (AKER.OL), now expects daily output in 2019 to average 155,000 barrels of oil equivalents (boepd), down from a July forecast of 155,000-160,000 boepd. The company blamed the lower forecast on a delay in starting new wells at the North Sea Valhall field, following maintenance in June, adding that there was no impact on reserves. Aker BP’s average output stood at only 144,000 boepd for the first nine months of the year, but the Sverdrup field, brought on stream by operator Equinor (EQNR.OL) on Oct. 5, a month ahead of schedule, will give a significant fourth-quarter boost. With reserves of 2.7 billion barrels of oil and expected to reach production of some 440,000 boepd by mid-2020, the field - in which Aker BP owns 11.57% - is the largest Norwegian oil development in more than 30 years. Meanwhile, Aker BP’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) fell to $480 million in the third quarter from $698 million a year ago, in line with a $478 million forecast in a Refinitiv poll of analysts. The company had warned on Oct. 14 that third-quarter output was weaker than expected as seasonal maintenance at some fields had taken longer than expected. It had also warned in advance of $80 million goodwill impairments and additional costs from repairs of some $14 million, which helped push its third-quarter net result to a loss of $43 million.

751,2019-10-23 21:53:00,2019,10.0,23,Harry Cheadle,BP Thinks You Selfish Pricks Aren’t Doing Enough to Fight Climate Change,"Back in 2010, software engineer Raffi Krikorian estimated that every tweet consumes 0.02 grams of CO2. Sure, that isn't very much, but it's hard to imagine a worse use of that speck of carbon than this missive from the official BP account: If you followed that link, in doing so consuming ever so slightly more carbon and therefore infinitesimally hastening the heating of our planet, you'd find yourself on a website decorated with drawings of planes and bikes and whatever. You are prompted to answer some questions about your consumption habits—how often you fly, how much meat you eat—and at the end it spits out a number representing the estimated amount of carbon you're responsible for emitting in a year. I love taking online quizzes, so I did this and got 19 metric tons, which is well above the global average of about 5. I was then given the opportunity to promise to change my behavior. The idea that we all need to do our part to fight climate change is everywhere. NBC News recently launched a project asking for people's ""Climate Confessions,"" which framed everyday activities as lurid sins: ""Where do you fall short in preventing climate change? Do you blast the A/C? Throw out half your lunch? Grill a steak every week?"" The New York Times has written articles about how guilty you should feel about flying and the most carbon-efficient way to boil water. The assumption you can get from reading those sorts of stories is that if everyone works together and takes the bus and makes sure to turn off the lights when leaving the house, we'll have licked this climate change problem. The fact that the company formerly known as British Petroleum is echoing this line should be a big, flaming signpost that this way of thinking is missing the forest for the trees. I should definitely stop flying as much and stop eating meat in order to reduce my personal carbon footprint, but my sins don't even remotely compare to the sins of BP's business practices. An accounting of the environmental damage done by BP would start with 2010's Deepwater Horizon spill, one of the most devastating such events in history. But even as BP has tried to clean up its reputation—for instance by leaving the conservative climate-denying group ALEC in 2015—it has remained a major culprit when it comes to carbon emissions. As much as it has tried to position itself as pivoting to alternative energy sources, it continues to expand its oil and gas operations and maintains wasteful practices like ""flaring"" natural gas during drilling, burning the fuel away because it can't transport it quickly enough. And not only does BP contribute to the climate crisis through its everyday extraction and transportation operation, it supports political efforts to kneecap reform. According to a report on fossil fuel companies from the watchdog group InfluenceMap released earlier this year, BP has joined other giant firms in fighting government regulations and donated nearly $13 million to the successful effort to block a referendum on what would have been a landmark carbon tax in Washington State. (That's despite BP claiming that it supports a ""well-designed"" carbon pricing system.) There's no field in that BP-pushed website where you can enter how much money you've donated to politicians or causes, or describe your efforts to influence the kind of climate policy we urgently need. But a lot of activists say that the most important thing you can do has nothing to do with consumption habits—instead, they say, you should join the effort to pressure politicians to enact carbon taxes and go further by passing far-reaching legislation on the scale of the Green New Deal. That type of activism likely makes BP nervous. Calls to move away from natural gas, for instance, are a direct threat to the parts of BP that sell natural gas. It evidently doesn't want to do that. It's easier to tell me that I should stop driving my Prius so much. I'd be happy to sell my car, and stop flying altogether, go vegan, and go AC-less, even if it meant sweating through the summers—if, in return, BP would stop funding efforts to block climate legislation and begin dismantling its oil and natural gas operations. We can stop, or at least mitigate, climate change if we all work together. Some of us, though, have more consequential decisions to make than others.

Polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, is one of the most widely recycled plastics. About 27 million tonnes of PET is used annually in packaging, with bottles accounting for around 23 million tonnes of that, BP said in a statement, citing data from consultancy Wood Mackenzie. However, only around 60% of PET used for bottles is recovered, with the vast majority recycled only once before being either buried in landfill or burnt as the current recycling process leaves a lot of impurities. BP said that its new recycling technology, named Infinia, can transform used PET plastics into brand-new plastic feedstock, allowing them to be recycled repeatedly. The company will build a $25 million plant in the United States in 2020 to test the technology before deciding on whether it can be fully commercialized. BP’s head of refining and petrochemicals Tufan Erginbilgic said the technology was a “game-changer” for the plastics recycling industry. “It is an important stepping stone in enabling a stronger circular economy in the polyester industry and helping to reduce unmanaged plastic waste,” Erginbilgic said.

754,2019-10-24 00:00:00,2019,10.0,24,,"Put a price on carbon and watch emissions fall, BP's Bob Dudley says","BP chief executive Bob Dudley has called for a ""united effort to put a price on carbon,"" claiming it would act faster at cutting CO2 emissions than any warning from politicians. Speaking at the One Young World conference in London on Wednesday, Dudley told an audience that ""unless you put a price on something,"" you can't control how it's consumed. ""One of the things we talk most about doesn't have a price,"" he said. ""There's got to be a united effort to put a price on carbon, so when you click a switch on the wall for electricity you're going to pay a higher price."" ""Get a price on carbon and boy, the market will respond,"" Dudley added. ""That's going to change the (emissions) situation more than 18-month or four-year outlooks from politicians."" The outgoing BP boss noted that while emissions were stagnating in Europe and North America, other parts of the world were falling behind in addressing the climate crisis. ""There are big coal-fired power plants opening in other parts of the world and that's the epicenter of the problem,"" he said. According to researchers at the London School of Economics, a carbon price can be implemented in one of two ways. Governments can either add a levy to the distribution, sale or use of fossil fuels based on their carbon content, or use a quota system called cap-and-trade, which sets regional emissions allowances in advance and lets companies bid for ""permits to pollute."" Funds raised through carbon pricing can also be reinvested into programs aimed at further reducing pollution. In an email on Thursday, David Robinson, economist at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, told CNBC that pricing carbon could be an effective way to reduce emissions. ""In the power sector, a high enough carbon tax would penalize coal-fired plants and can lead to their closure and replacement by other lower carbon technologies, like gas or renewables,"" he said. ""If electricity companies think carbon prices will be high in future, they will be more likely to invest in low-carbon (alternatives) and avoid investing in coal. The financial community would also be reluctant to support investment in high-carbon products, including coal-fired plants and conventional vehicles."" ""The shift to less carbon intensive energies and products may not lower energy demand, but it will lead to lower CO2 emissions,"" he added. One report in March this year, published by the Global Energy Monitor, claimed falling costs of renewable energy are already reducing the number of coal-fired power plants. And a separate report, from Canada's Ecofiscal Commission (EC) — an economic research organization — explored how carbon pricing measures had been implemented globally. It claimed that a cap-and-trade model implemented by 10 U.S. states in 2009 resulted in a 20% decline in emissions from electricity between 2012 and 2019. It also found that a carbon tax introduced in British Columbia, Canada, in 2008 had reduced the use of gasoline and natural gas in the province by 7% per person. Elsewhere, carbon pricing initiatives in Tokyo, the U.K. and Sweden had also helped to drastically reduce emissions and the use of fossil fuels, the report claimed. In the long-term, ramifications of emissions pricing would likely see consumers switching to renewable energy providers or even opting to generate their own electricity, Robinson told CNBC. ""(But) if final electricity prices rise too much and too fast, there is always the risk of a consumer back-lash, like we have seen with the gilets jaunes in France,"" he warned. ""For this reason, it is critical to ensure that any new tax has political and social support and that vulnerable consumers are protected.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/24/put-a-price-on-carbon-and-watch-emissions-fall-bps-bob-dudley-says.html,Energy,CNBC

BP's chief executive for biofuels, Mario Lindenhayn, told reporters on the sidelines of Datagro's sugar conference in Sao Paulo the oil major was just waiting for the green light of antitrust bodies in three countries, including China, to close the deal. ""We already had the approval from Brazil and the European Union, and we are expecting remaining approvals still this year, that is the objective,"" Lindenhayn said. BP and Bunge announced in July the deal to merge their Brazilian sugar and ethanol operations. BP agreed to transfer $700 million of Bunge's debt to the new venture, and make an additional cash payment of $75 million to Bunge. The resulting company will have 11 plants in Brazil and capacity to crush 32 million tonnes of cane per year. Lindenhayn said BP sees an opportunity for continued growth in ethanol consumption in Brazil for years, despite changes in the global auto industry toward electrification. He said he believed the current fuel infrastructure in Brazil, with ethanol pumps spread over all states, makes it likely that flex fuel cars and hybrid vehicles that will use ethanol will continue to dominate the market for years to come. Lindenhayn also said he felt positive regarding the potential for increased ethanol blending in gasoline in large fuel-consuming countries such as India and China, which could help boost the global market for the biofuel.

BP posted third-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, used as a proxy for net profit, of $2.3 billion, versus $2 billion, according to data from Refinitiv. That compared with a profit of $3.8 billion over the same period a year earlier and $2.8 billion in the second quarter of 2019. The results show that the U.K.-based oil and gas company still managed to beat analyst expectations, despite a sharp drop in third-quarter net profits. Shares of BP dipped 0.5% shortly after the opening bell. ""Overall, it has actually given us a strong set of underlying earnings but, more importantly, strong operating cash — which has allowed us to stabilize debt this quarter,"" BP CFO Brian Gilvary told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday. Gilvary said that while oil prices were ""pretty finely poised,"" crude futures seemed to be stabilizing somewhere around $60 a barrel. ""I think that sets us up well given we have got the company back into balance at $50 a barrel about two and a half years ago. So, therefore, we start to generate more surplus cash (and) that surplus cash will help us pay down the debt,"" he added. International benchmark Brent crude traded at $61.32 Tuesday morning, down around 0.4%, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) stood at $55.53, more than 0.5% lower. Brent crude prices have fallen almost 20% since an April peak, while WTI prices are down more than 15% over the same period. The report comes shortly after CEO Bob Dudley, who has worked with BP for 40 years and held the position of CEO for almost a decade, announced he would be soon be stepping down from his role. Dudley will be replaced by the current upstream chief executive, Bernard Looney, following the delivery of the firm's 2019 full-year results on February 4, 2020. In September, Dudley said BP would look to sell some of its most carbon-intensive projects, and reduce investment in others, to try to improve the firm's environmental footprint. The energy giant has been targeted by climate activist groups on numerous occasions in recent months, with demonstrators increasingly angry about the lack of progress toward a lower-carbon future. Shares of BP are down more than 4% from the same period in 2018, with weaker energy prices and sluggish global demand seen as likely to weigh on the oil industry as major energy companies report third-quarter earnings. Royal Dutch Shell is expected to report its latest quarterly figures on Thursday, with U.S. rivals Chevron and Exxon Mobil both set to report earnings on Friday.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/29/bp-earnings-q3-2019.html,Earnings,CNBC
757,2019-10-04 00:00:00,2019,10.0,4,Hanna Ziady,"Bob Dudley, BP CEO, retires after rescuing company from Deepwater Horizon disaster ","London (CNN Business)Bob Dudley, the American chief executive who rescued BP from its Deepwater Horizon disaster, is stepping down.  BP (BP) said Friday that Dudley, 64, would retire at the end of March 2020 after 40 years with the company, including nine as CEO.  Dudley took on the top job at the British oil company in October 2010, just six months after an explosion at its Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico killed 11 workers and severely damaged marine life. The accident led to the departure of Dudley's predecessor, Tony Hayward, and triggered a costly nightmare for the company. It was ""probably the most challenging time in BP's history,"" BP chairman Helge Lund said in a statement.  ""During his tenure [Dudley] has led the recovery from the Deepwater Horizon accident, rebuilt BP as a stronger, safer company and helped it re-earn its position as one of the leaders of the energy sector,"" Lund added.  Regarded as one of the worst oils spills in history, the Deepwater Horizon incident is expected to cost BP nearly $62 billion in litigation and clean-up costs. BP expects to be paying for the damage for another 15 years. Oil from the spill continues to leak into the Gulf of Mexico. BP's shares have bounced 60% from a low hit in June 2010, but are still 24% below where they were trading before the disaster.  Like its rivals, BP under Dudley also had to deal with a collapse in oil prices to $26 a barrel in 2014. That forced them to streamline operations — BP alone cut 7,000 jobs by the end of 2017. But prices have since recovered, and the company bet big on US shale last year, buying major oil assets from mining firm BHP (BBL) for $10.5 billion in what was its first major US investment since Deepwater Horizon. BP profits more than doubled in 2018. Analysts at Wood Mackenzie said in March that BP had transformed its portfolio and was poised to become the world's largest international oil company by production. ""BP is in the midst of an unprecedented phase of growth,"" they said.  New challenge, new CEO Oil companies are also facing mounting pressure from investors, governments and activists to move into renewable energy to tackle the climate crisis. Like most of the oil industry, BP still generates virtually all its profit from non-renewable energy sources and has advocated for alternative solutions to achieving emissions targets, such as carbon capture use and storage.  BP invested $500 million in low carbon activities in 2018, according to its annual report. Those investments included FreeWire, a manufacturer of charging systems for electric vehicles. It has rolled out FreeWire technology in the United Kingdom and Europe, and said in August that it had teamed up with ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing to build a network of charging points across China, the world's largest market for electric vehicles. Earlier this year, Climate Action 100+ — a group of 300 investors representing £32 trillion ($39.3 trillion) in assets — criticized BP for failing to demonstrate that its strategy was consistent with climate goals. BP later pledged to link the bonuses of 36,000 employees to greenhouse gas reduction targets.  ""As the company charts its course through the energy transition this is a logical time for a change,"" said Lund.  Bernard Looney, who joined BP in 1991 and succeeds Dudley, will take on that challenge. Looney, 49, is currently chief executive of BP's upstream business, which includes its activities in oil and natural gas exploration. Looney would ""thoughtfully lead BP through the transition to a low carbon future,"" Dudley said. Dudley has so far been paid $118.6 million as CEO, BP's latest annual report shows, excluding his remuneration for this year.

Speaking at Rio’s Offshore Technology Conference on Tuesday, BP Regional President for Latin America Felipe Arbelaez said he believed a plant being built by a consortium of BP, Germany’s Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) and Brazil’s Prumo Logistica SA (LLXLF.PK) could eventually be fired by offshore gas rather than imported liquefied natural gas (LNG), as plans now forecast. “Associated gas can definitely compete with LNG in Brazil, and there is tons of associated gas,” Arbelaez said, using a term for the gas pumped from fields that primarily produce oil. “BP, over time, if I had to guess, will be satisfied with associated gas,” he said. Offshore gas is considered both a problem and opportunity in Brazil. The country is quickly ramping up oil production in offshore fields, many of which have significant gas volumes. Traditionally, gas produced in such fields is burned off or “re-injected” in a process that increases crude production. But some fields coming online have too much gas for those processes to remain viable. At the same time, there are few pipelines to bring the gas ashore and domestic consumption is weak. The government is encouraging more gas infrastructure, and firms with gas-heavy fields, such as Norway’s Equinor ASA (EQNR.OL), are looking at building pipelines and onshore terminals. “We’re convinced that there is a need for additional infrastructure to be built,” Arbelaez said. “We believe there is probably a need for between two to three ... gas processing corridors in the next 10 to 15 years.” During the same panel, executives from Equinor and Portugal’s Galp Energia SGPS SA (GALP.LS) also said they expected to be selling offshore Brazilian gas to consumers within the next two years. “I have the certainty that Galp will be selling gas in the next two years to clients,” said Miguel Pereira, chief executive of Petrogal, a Galp unit. “We have to surpass some barriers but we are dealing with it.” Reporting by Gram Slattery; Editing by Brad Haynes and Stephen Coates",https://www.reuters.com/article/brazil-oil-otc-gas/bp-eyes-brazil-gas-buildout-may-swap-lng-imports-for-domestic-output-idUSL2N27E1KT,Business News,Reuters

That compared with demand growth of 1.3 million bpd in the first three months of the year and 1 million bpd in the second quarter, Gilvary said. “It really is finely balanced at around $60,” Gilvary said. “We are seeing demand impacted by uncertainty over U.S.- China trade tensions,” he said.

761,2019-10-29 00:00:00,2019,10.0,29,Ron Bousso,BP profits fall 40% as oil prices slide,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP’s (BP.L) profits fell sharply in the third quarter, hurt by lower oil prices, but strong refining operations helped the company beat expectations even after taking a one-off $2.6 billion charge linked to asset sales. BP, like other big energy companies, has been hit by a sharp drop in oil prices as trade tensions between the United States and China have impacted global oil demand. The British oil company made its first net loss in more than three years in the quarter due to the one-off charge, but Chief Executive Bob Dudley, who will step down next year after a decade at the helm, said underlying earnings and cash flow were strong. Cash flow from operations was unchanged in the quarter from a year earlier at $6.1 billion despite a 17% drop in oil prices. “In a challenging quarter for energy, BP results are remarkably resilient,” Bernstein analyst Oswald Clint said. (Graphic: BP Q3 profits, here) The $2.6 billion charge resulted in a $700 million net loss but this will not come as a surprise to investors. BP flagged earlier this month it would take a non-cash charge of $2 billion to $3 billion in the quarter as it gets closer to disposing of assets worth $10 billion by the end of 2019, a year ahead of schedule. So far this year, BP’s proceeds from divestments reached $1.4 billion. BP last year acquired BHP’s U.S. shale assets for $10.25 billion that turned BP into one of the largest shale oil drillers. It also announced the sale of its Alaskan business to Hilcorp Energy Co for $5.6 billion. BP shares were down 1.2% by 0928 GMT, compared with a 0.33% decline for the broader FTSE index .FTSE. Third-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, the company’s definition of net income, fell 40% from the year earlier period to $2.3 billion. That exceeded a forecast of $1.73 billion in a company-provided survey of analysts and compared to $2.81 billion in the second quarter of 2019. In a sign of confidence, BP eliminated a scrip dividend for the quarter which allows investors to get shares instead of cash, a measure used during the industry downturn. Oil and gas production, excluding BP’s share from its 19.75% stake in Russia’s Rosneft, was down 2.5% from a year earlier at 2.568 million barrels of oil equivalent per day as a result of maintenance at several high-margin fields and a two-week disruption to production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico from Hurricane Barry. BP said production in the fourth quarter would be higher than in the previous quarter as maintenance winds down. On the oil demand outlook, Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary told Reuters demand remained under pressure globally from trade tensions between the United States and China. The weakness in oil and gas production was offset by a strong performance in BP’s refining and chemicals businesses and higher than expected earnings from Rosneft, which helped lower BP’s tax rate. BP’s capital spending was set to be below $16 billion in 2019, Gilvary said. Dudley will be succeeded by head of upstream Bernard Looney, 49, who oversaw deep cost cuts at the company and the BHP deal.

Market losses accelerated after a Reuters report that a “phase one” trade agreement between Washington and Beijing may not be signed next month, aggravating pessimism over the U.S.-China trade war. The FTSE 100 dipped 0.3%, its biggest daily drop in ten days, pulling back from the previous session’s near one-month high. The mid-cap FTSE 250 was down 0.2%. Oil major BP was the biggest drag on the main bourse, sliding 4.2% after reporting a sharp drop in third-quarter earnings on the back of weaker oil prices and lower production. “Stock markets in Europe are largely in the red this afternoon as the feelgood factor from the Brexit delay has been replaced by the caution of a possible general election in the UK,” CMC Markets analyst David Madden said. “Elections can be risky... the Conservatives are polling well ahead of the Labour Party but traders have learned not to rely on opinion polls given the events of the past three years, hence why equities are down.” While the European Union on Monday agreed to a Brexit delay of up to three months, much remained unclear as lawmakers argued over how, when or even if the UK should leave the bloc. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he will again push for a general election, which the Labour party said it would now back as a no-deal Brexit was off the table. Investors are also awaiting the conclusion of this week’s U.S. Federal Reserve meeting, at which the central bank is expected to cut interest rates for the third time this year to boost a slowing economy amid an ongoing trade war with China. “We expect a pickup in global growth in the next six to 12 months, yet see limits to how much monetary easing can be delivered in the near term,” BlackRock analysts said. “Monetary policy is no cure for the weaker growth and firmer inflation pressures that may result from sustained trade tensions.” Financial companies, whose margins would be under pressure in a low interest rate scenario, were the second biggest sector-wide drag on the FTSE 100 as they tumbled 1% to their lowest level in two weeks.

765,2019-10-29 00:00:00,2019,10.0,29,Ron Bousso,BP profits fall 40% as oil prices slide,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP’s (BP.L) profits fell sharply in the third quarter, hurt by lower oil prices, but strong refining operations helped the company beat expectations even after taking a one-off $2.6 billion charge linked to asset sales. BP, like other big energy companies, has been hit by a sharp drop in oil prices as trade tensions between the United States and China have impacted global oil demand. The British oil company made its first net loss in more than three years in the quarter due to the one-off charge, but Chief Executive Bob Dudley, who will step down next year after a decade at the helm, said underlying earnings and cash flow were strong. Cash flow from operations was unchanged in the quarter from a year earlier at $6.1 billion despite a 17% drop in oil prices. “In a challenging quarter for energy, BP results are remarkably resilient,” Bernstein analyst Oswald Clint said. (Graphic: BP Q3 profits, here) The $2.6 billion charge resulted in a $700 million net loss but this will not come as a surprise to investors. BP flagged earlier this month it would take a non-cash charge of $2 billion to $3 billion in the quarter as it gets closer to disposing of assets worth $10 billion by the end of 2019, a year ahead of schedule. So far this year, BP’s proceeds from divestments reached $1.4 billion. BP last year acquired BHP’s U.S. shale assets for $10.25 billion that turned BP into one of the largest shale oil drillers. It also announced the sale of its Alaskan business to Hilcorp Energy Co for $5.6 billion. BP shares were down 1.2% by 0928 GMT, compared with a 0.33% decline for the broader FTSE index .FTSE. Third-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, the company’s definition of net income, fell 40% from the year earlier period to $2.3 billion. That exceeded a forecast of $1.73 billion in a company-provided survey of analysts and compared to $2.81 billion in the second quarter of 2019. In a sign of confidence, BP eliminated a scrip dividend for the quarter which allows investors to get shares instead of cash, a measure used during the industry downturn. Oil and gas production, excluding BP’s share from its 19.75% stake in Russia’s Rosneft, was down 2.5% from a year earlier at 2.568 million barrels of oil equivalent per day as a result of maintenance at several high-margin fields and a two-week disruption to production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico from Hurricane Barry. BP said production in the fourth quarter would be higher than in the previous quarter as maintenance winds down. On the oil demand outlook, Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary told Reuters demand remained under pressure globally from trade tensions between the United States and China. The weakness in oil and gas production was offset by a strong performance in BP’s refining and chemicals businesses and higher than expected earnings from Rosneft, which helped lower BP’s tax rate. BP’s capital spending was set to be below $16 billion in 2019, Gilvary said. Dudley will be succeeded by head of upstream Bernard Looney, 49, who oversaw deep cost cuts at the company and the BHP deal.

BP’s chief executive for biofuels, Mario Lindenhayn, told reporters on the sidelines of Datagro’s sugar conference in Sao Paulo the oil major was just waiting for the green light of antitrust bodies in three countries, including China, to close the deal. “We already had the approval from Brazil and the European Union, and we are expecting remaining approvals still this year, that is the objective,” Lindenhayn said. BP and Bunge announced in July the deal to merge their Brazilian sugar and ethanol operations. BP agreed to transfer $700 million of Bunge’s debt to the new venture, and make an additional cash payment of $75 million to Bunge. The resulting company will have 11 plants in Brazil and capacity to crush 32 million tonnes of cane per year. Lindenhayn said BP sees an opportunity for continued growth in ethanol consumption in Brazil for years, despite changes in the global auto industry toward electrification. He said he believed the current fuel infrastructure in Brazil, with ethanol pumps spread over all states, makes it likely that flex fuel cars and hybrid vehicles that will use ethanol will continue to dominate the market for years to come.

Speaking at Rio’s Offshore Technology Conference on Tuesday, BP Regional President for Latin America Felipe Arbelaez said he believed a plant being built by a consortium of BP, Germany’s Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) and Brazil’s Prumo Logistica SA (LLXLF.PK) could eventually be fired by offshore gas rather than imported liquefied natural gas (LNG), as plans now forecast. “Associated gas can definitely compete with LNG in Brazil, and there is tons of associated gas,” Arbelaez said, using a term for the gas pumped from fields that primarily produce oil. “BP, over time, if I had to guess, will be satisfied with associated gas,” he said. Offshore gas is considered both a problem and opportunity in Brazil. The country is quickly ramping up oil production in offshore fields, many of which have significant gas volumes. Traditionally, gas produced in such fields is burned off or “re-injected” in a process that increases crude production. But some fields coming online have too much gas for those processes to remain viable. At the same time, there are few pipelines to bring the gas ashore and domestic consumption is weak. The government is encouraging more gas infrastructure, and firms with gas-heavy fields, such as Norway’s Equinor ASA (EQNR.OL), are looking at building pipelines and onshore terminals. “We’re convinced that there is a need for additional infrastructure to be built,” Arbelaez said. “We believe there is probably a need for between two to three ... gas processing corridors in the next 10 to 15 years.” During the same panel, executives from Equinor and Portugal’s Galp Energia SGPS SA (GALP.LS) also said they expected to be selling offshore Brazilian gas to consumers within the next two years. “I have the certainty that Galp will be selling gas in the next two years to clients,” said Miguel Pereira, chief executive of Petrogal, a Galp unit. “We have to surpass some barriers but we are dealing with it.” Reporting by Gram Slattery; Editing by Brad Haynes and Stephen Coates",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-oil-otc-gas/bp-eyes-brazil-gas-buildout-may-swap-lng-imports-for-domestic-output-idUSKBN1X82TB,Business News,Reuters

Adriano Bastos argued that, even if the pre-salt areas that have not received any bids are auctioned again with better terms, other projects elsewhere in the world will attract such multinational oil firms, reducing their capacity to invest in Brazil, according to the paper. “Capital that has not yet come to Brazil will not come next year. Other projects were sanctioned ... It will restrict my capacity to invest in Brazil,” he told Valor, adding that Iran has announced a huge oil discovery and pointing to the upcoming initial public offering of Saudi state oil giant Aramco.

According to Bloomberg, it made the unusual decision to sail home with no cargo on board, part of a plan to avoid Iranian hostility.Iran had threatened to target a British tanker after Royal Marines helped seize an Iranian tanker off the coast of Gibraltar, which officials say was violating sanctions by shipping oil to Syria.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.The British oil tanker which Iran confronted with three gunboats is a BP ship which was worried that it may get caught up in just such a skirmish.The ship — the British Heritage — was confronted by Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) on Wednesday.According to the UK government, the vessels ordered the British Heritage tanker to change course, leaving the international waters of the Strait of Hormuz in order to enter Iranian waters instead.In response, a Royal Navy frigate — HMS Montrose — placed itself between the tanker and the Iranian boats, aimed its weapons at the Iranians, and gave ""verbal warnings"" for them to leave, the British government said.The Iranian vessels then sailed away.







BP confirmed to Business Insider that the British Heritage carries oil for the company, but declined to give further details.Business Insider understands that the oil tanker was not carrying any cargo when the IRGC approached it.A spokesman for the British oil company told Business Insider: ""Our top priority is the safety and security of our crews and vessels. While we are not commenting on these events, we thank the Royal Navy for their support.""The incident took place when the British Heritage was passing by Abu Musa island off Dubai, Sky News foreign affairs editor Deborah Haynes reported.Read more: How the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow stretch of water where ships transport $1.2 billion worth of oil every day, is at the heart of spiraling tensions with Iran







The British Heritage worried that it might get attacked by IranThe British Heritage was behaving cautiously before Wednesday's incident, after Iran made repeated threats to target a British tanker in retaliation for the seizure of one of its own vessels.British Royal Marines helped seize an Iranian tanker — the Grace 1 — off the coast of Gibraltar, a British territory, on July 4.Gibraltar officials say they stopped the ship because it was carrying Iranian oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions. The incident prompted Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to say, according to Reuters: ""You [Britain] are the initiator of insecurity and you will realise the consequences later.""Read more: A seized Iranian tanker took a several-thousand-mile detour around Africa in a possible attempt to sneak a shipment of crude oil to Syria







BP had been taking measures to make sure the British Heritage would not be attacked by Iran after the Gibraltar incident, according to a Bloomberg report published on Monday.According to the report, the British Heritage had been sailing toward Iraq's southern Basrah terminal to pick up cargo, but made an abrupt U-turn on July 6, two days after the Gibraltar incident.







BP declined to comment on Bloomberg's story.However, a source close to the company told Business Insider that the British Heritage had been sailing toward Basrah, and did not end up picking up cargo from the Iraqi port.A UK government spokesperson told Business Insider's David Choi on Wednesday: ""We are concerned by this action and continue to urge the Iranian authorities to de-escalate the situation in the region.""",https://www.businessinsider.com/british-heritage-bp-oil-tanker-harassed-scared-iran-target-2019-7,,Business Insider
785,2019-08-02 15:10:00,2019,8.0,2,Hirsh Chitkara,BP and Didi partner on electric vehicle charging stations in China,"Multinational oil and gas company BP and Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi announced a joint venture (JV) to construct as many as 200 electric-vehicle (EV) charging stations in China by the end of 2020. The JV comes shortly after the two companies piloted a charging station in May 2019, which offered ten fast-charging units of 60-120kW. 






 

Here's what it means for Didi: The JV is another piece of Didi's efforts to create a robust mobility ecosystem for both its drivers and riders.An estimated 600,000 vehicle operators on Didi's platform drive EVs, and should find the charging program especially appealing. A Didi spokesperson said the BP collaboration will help the company ""provide [a] better experience for car owners across the country.""Didi stands to benefit if this ""better experience"" allows it to attract and retain drivers, which can translate into a competitive advantage — competing platforms would struggle to match the breadth and depth of service offerings enabled by a strategic partnership with such a major corporation. This could help Didi stave off competitors in China's $23 billion ride-hailing industry, while leveraging its market dominance to expand revenue in tangential services.But because the EV stations will also be open to non-Didi drivers, they also represent a bolstering of Didi's greater mobility ambitions. The EV stations that are part of the deal with BP will connect with the Didi-owned Xiaoju Automobile Solutions (XAS) platform, which is where Didi aggregates its mobility services. Didi invested $1 billion into XAS last year in an effort to expand beyond the core business of ride hailing.Here's what it means for BP: The JV will help BP capture a larger share of the EV market in China, as integration with the Didi platform differentiates the company from other energy providers.EVs can run on alternative energies such as hydroelectric, renewables, and nuclear. This could threaten BP's core business of providing energy in the form of gas and oil. Rather than resisting this shift, BP hopes it can capitalize on it in China, which contains about half of all EVs sold globally, per BP.According to Automotive News, BP believes the venture could be ""scaled up to thousands of hubs across China to reach a leading market position."" This could be a massive market, as China's government has set a target of 4.8 million EV charging stations by 2020. There are an estimated 770,00 EV charging stations in China today.The bigger picture: This deal is part of a rising effort by traditional oil and gas companies to hedge against the decline of fossil fuel consumption, especially in the transportation sector.Global demand for gasoline is set to peak around 2021, in part due to the rise of EVs, according to Quartz. As a result, oil and gas companies are beginning to invest in EV infrastructure, which will help them future proof their business model.For example, both Royal Dutch Shell and French multinational oil and gas company Total both acquired EV charging firms over the last year. We expect this trend to not only continue but also accelerate, especially as EVs come to represent a larger share of total vehicles on the road. Interested in getting the full story?

As guests of the event arrived, the activists processed to the main entrance of the museum where they were drenched in oil by Petroleus. In addition to the five “living statues,” there was a Greek Chorus made up of around 15 people who chanted the slogan: “We foresee the fall of BP!”  Our ""living statues"" are now stood at the main entrance to the @britishmuseum, greeting guests arriving for the VIP launch of the @BP_plc-sponsored #TroyExhibition! And Petroleus, who wears an oil slick over his shoulders, has begun to stain the other statues with oil… #DropBP pic.twitter.com/rekrKEpFaf — BP or not BP? (@drop_BP) November 19, 2019 A spokesperson from the British Museum told Hyperallergic: “The reception went ahead as planned and guests were able to see and enjoy the exhibition. The British Museum respects other people’s right to express their views and allows peaceful protest onsite at the Museum as long as there is no risk to the Museum’s collection, staff or visitors.”  Over the last year, the British Museum has come under increasing pressure to cut ties with the fossil fuel multinational. Out of the 57 rebel performances organized by BP or Not BP? to date, 37 have taken place at the British Museum, which is one of the four beneficiaries of BP’s five-year £7.5 million (~$9 million) donation supporting British cultural institutions, a commitment which is supposed to continue until 2022.  BP or Not BP? accuses BP of using arts institutions to whitewash its reputation, while continuing its oil and gas expansion. In a statement emailed to Hyperallergic, Stephen Corrigan from BP or not BP? said: “According to the climate science, we cannot afford to build any new oil or gas infrastructure if we want a decent chance of avoiding climate breakdown — and yet BP is planning to spend tens of billions of pounds on these kinds of projects over the next ten years.”  In July, a trustee of the British Museum, Ahdaf Soueif, an Egyptian novelist and political commentator, stepped down from the board, citing the museum’s relationship with BP as one of the reasons for her departure. In an  op-ed published in the London Review of Books, she said she regretted the institution’s lack of engagement with “the legitimate and pressing concerns of young people across the planet.” Soon after, British museum workers issued a statement in solidarity with Soueif. Other BP-sponsored institutions in the UK have recently announced their decision to sever ties with the oil company. Last month the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) pulled out of its sponsorship deal with BP, and a week ago the National Galleries of Scotland declared that it would no longer host the annual BP Portrait Award, citing the “climate emergency” as the reason for refusing further funding from BP.  In response to yesterday’s protest, a spokesperson for BP told Hyperallergic: “We do understand that people have concerns about this kind of support and it’s right that those questions are raised. Without external support much programming and other major projects would not happen. This exhibition focuses on Troy as the ultimate universal story about the human condition. It features compelling characters and timeless themes: heroism and violence; love and loss; hope and despair, addressing themes as relevant now as they were 3000 years ago.” Continuing the Greco-Trojan theme, BP or Not BP? has crowd-funded the construction of a gigantic Trojan Horse, which they will bring to the museum for another protest against the museum’s acceptance of sponsorship from BP for the Troy exhibition. The protest, which takes place on February 8, 2020, is being described by the group as their largest direct action yet. ",https://hyperallergic.com/529294/activists-dressed-as-trojan-figures-crash-opening-of-bp-funded-exhibition/,,Hyperallergic

The 50-50 joint venture BP Bunge Bioenergia, which will manage 11 plants in five Brazilian states with a total capacity to crush 32 million tonnes of sugarcane per year, will rank only behind Raízen, the joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Brazilian energy group Cosan SA. When the deal was announced back in July, the combined group was still holding a third position among the world's largest processors, but since then Biosev, the sugar and ethanol unit controlled by commodities trader Louis Dreyfus, reduced its crushing as it sold two mills in Brazil's northeast. The completion of the deal means BP and Bunge obtained all the regulatory approvals needed. It allows both companies to put together staff and start to plan jointly for the next Brazilian sugarcane season that starts in April. Brazil is finishing processing for the current season, with most mills already ending their cane crushing operations. Bunge will receive cash proceeds of $775 million in the deal, of which $700 million is Bunge's debt that will be assumed by the JV. Bunge said the non-recourse debt was arranged by a syndicate of banks led by Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, ABN Amro Bank NV and ING Bank NV. Brazil's Itaú BBA acted as financial advisor to Bunge, and Lefosse Advogados acted as legal counsel. The new JV has a clear focus on ethanol, as demand for the biofuel in Brazil has grown for the last two years and a new federal program to boost biofuels use kicks off next year. ""Biofuels are an increasingly important component of a low carbon energy system,"" said in a statement Mario Lindenhayn, BP's biofuels head, which will become executive chairman of the venture.

790,2019-12-03 00:00:00,2019,12.0,3,,Montana residents push BP's Arco to clean up their backyards | TheHill,"Shared Destiny. Shared Responsibility. A Supreme Court case puts environmental standards in the spotlight after Montana locals sue BP’s Atlantic Richfield Company. Story at a glance On Tuesday, a coalition of residents from a small Montana township will journey to the Supreme Court. Their fight is a timely one, with the climate change movement revving up significantly, so many eyes are on the case. The plaintiffs are challenging the Atlantic Richfield Company (Arco), a BP subsidiary, to clean up their lands after long-term mining projects left toxic chemicals on their properties.  According to NPR, residents of Opportunity and Crackerville, Montana, demand that Arco increase their cleanup efforts to remove arsenic and lead debris leftover on their land after years of mining operations. Arco states that it has spent approximately $450 million in cleanup efforts and falls in line with the current Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards. If the Montana landowners win this case, however, the EPA provision on arsenic cleanup could change.  The mining site in question is formally called the Anaconda Co. Smelter site, on the former copper mining facility of the same name. EPA reports state that from more than a century of mining on that site, “high concentrations of arsenic, lead, copper, cadmium, and zinc were produced. These wastes contaminated soil, groundwater, and surface water with hazardous chemicals.” The EPA placed the Anaconda Co. Smelter location on a Superfund toxic waste program priority list to begin cleanup efforts in 1983.  Still, Opportunity residents assert that arsenic levels are too high. The case escalated when one resident was diagnosed with two types of cancer in two years, per an NPR report. Other issues residents are concerned about include their property values and the health of extended family.  After initially suing Arco in 2008, the Montana Supreme Court ruled in favor of Opportunity residents in 2017. The company then petitioned the Supreme Court, arguing that federal regulation trumps state rulings. Arco ultimately believes that the state ruling will hinder current cleanup efforts and make it worse. The Montana residents will focus on the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act as a defense. Known as CERCLA, it states that landowners are allowed to bring cleanup requests to state courts, according to Bloomberg Law. With multiple environmental activist groups watching closely, the forthcoming verdict could set an important precedent in regulations affecting climate change, sustainability, and the environment.

European oil companies like BP have been stepping up investment in renewable power to diversify their businesses in the face of global moves toward a lower carbon economy to combat climate change. Dev Sanyal, chief executive at BP’s Alternative Energy division said, renewables were attractive even though they usually offered lower returns than the company’s traditional oil and gas business. “You don’t actually have the volatility of the oil and gas commodity cycle, what you’ve got is a stable returns structure,” he said in an interview. Lightsource BP usually seeks corporate power purchase agreements for its renewable assets, which can provide years of visibility and stability of revenue. BP’s investment will also simplify the joint venture structure as Lightsource BP seeks to accelerate its drive toward 10 gigawatts (GW) of developed assets by the end of 2023, the companies said. Lightsource BP currently has around 2 GW of renewable capacity globally. BP invested $200 million in Lightsource when it took a 43% stake in 2017. No financial details relating to the stake increase on Thursday were disclosed.

792,2019-12-03 00:00:00,2019,12.0,3,Andrew Chung,U.S. Supreme Court leans toward BP unit in Montana Superfund case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices on Tuesday appeared inclined to shield a unit of British oil major BP Plc from claims seeking a more extensive cleanup of a Superfund hazardous waste site in Montana than what federal environmental officials had ordered. The nine justices heard arguments in an appeal by Atlantic Richfield Co of a Montana state court ruling allowing a group of private landowners within the sprawling site of its former Anaconda copper smelter in western Montana to bring their claims for restoration damages to trial. Liberal and conservative justices alike signaled their concern that landowners could interfere with land remediation efforts ordered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Atlantic Richfield said the lower court’s decision could lead to the filing of thousands more lawsuits against companies nationwide, and further complicate federally mandated improvements to contaminated land. Atlantic Richfield, backed by President Donald Trump’s administration and industry lobby groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, has spent $450 million on soil and ground water restoration at the site ordered by the EPA. The Superfund program, started in 1980, is intended to identify contaminated sites and ensure that those responsible for the pollution pay for the hazardous waste cleanup. It has been criticized over the years for slow efforts. The case hinges on the scope of the Superfund law, called the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. The Anaconda smelter, near the small community of Opportunity, Montana, operated between 1884 and 1980 and provided much of the world’s copper supply. The area is filled with creeks and streams that cross forests and farmland. It was designated as a Superfund site in 1983 to reduce arsenic contamination in residential yards, pastures and ground water. Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts said that there could be “significant adverse impacts” from landowners taking actions that the EPA would oppose, noting the agency’s concerns about ground water in the Montana case. Liberal Justice Stephen Breyer said channeling efforts through the EPA would avoid “10,000 juries or 50 states” imposing conflicting duties. Much of the argument focused on whether each landowner was considered a “potentially responsible party” who must seek the EPA’s approval under the law before undertaking restoration of their own contaminated land. The case began in 2008 when the landowners sued in state court to restore their properties to pre-smelter conditions. Atlantic Richfield said such state law claims were barred by the EPA’s actions under the Superfund law.

The 50-50 joint venture BP Bunge Bioenergia, which will manage 11 plants in five Brazilian states with a total capacity to crush 32 million tonnes of sugarcane per year, will rank only behind Raízen, the joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Brazilian energy group Cosan SA. When the deal was announced back in July, the combined group was still holding a third position among the world’s largest processors, but since then Biosev, the sugar and ethanol unit controlled by commodities trader Louis Dreyfus, reduced its crushing as it sold two mills in Brazil’s northeast. The completion of the deal means BP and Bunge obtained all the regulatory approvals needed. It allows both companies to put together staff and start to plan jointly for the next Brazilian sugarcane season that starts in April. Brazil is finishing processing for the current season, with most mills already ending their cane crushing operations. Bunge will receive cash proceeds of $775 million in the deal, of which $700 million is Bunge’s debt that will be assumed by the JV. Bunge said the non-recourse debt was arranged by a syndicate of banks led by Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, ABN Amro Bank NV and ING Bank NV. Brazil’s Itaú BBA acted as financial advisor to Bunge, and Lefosse Advogados acted as legal counsel. The new JV has a clear focus on ethanol, as demand for the biofuel in Brazil has grown for the last two years and a new federal program to boost biofuels use kicks off next year. “Biofuels are an increasingly important component of a low carbon energy system,” said in a statement Mario Lindenhayn, BP’s biofuels head, which will become executive chairman of the venture. Geovane Consul, former head of Bunge Açúcar e Bioenergia, will be the Chief Executive of BP Bunge Bioenergia. “We are positioning ourselves to support Brazil’s increasing demand for low-carbon bioenergy,” he said.

European oil companies like BP have been stepping up investment in renewable power to diversify their businesses in the face of global moves toward a lower carbon economy to combat climate change. Dev Sanyal, chief executive at BP’s Alternative Energy division said, renewables were attractive even though they usually offered lower returns than the company’s traditional oil and gas business. “You don’t actually have the volatility of the oil and gas commodity cycle, what you’ve got is a stable returns structure,” he said in an interview. Lightsource BP usually seeks corporate power purchase agreements for its renewable assets, which can provide years of visibility and stability of revenue. BP’s investment will also simplify the joint venture structure as Lightsource BP seeks to accelerate its drive toward 10 gigawatts (GW) of developed assets by the end of 2023, the companies said. Lightsource BP currently has around 2 GW of renewable capacity globally. BP invested $200 million in Lightsource when it took a 43% stake in 2017.

798,2019-12-03 00:00:00,2019,12.0,3,Andrew Chung,U.S. Supreme Court leans toward BP unit in Montana Superfund case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices on Tuesday appeared inclined to shield a unit of British oil major BP Plc from claims seeking a more extensive cleanup of a Superfund hazardous waste site in Montana than what federal environmental officials had ordered. The nine justices heard arguments in an appeal by Atlantic Richfield Co of a Montana state court ruling allowing a group of private landowners within the sprawling site of its former Anaconda copper smelter in western Montana to bring their claims for restoration damages to trial. Liberal and conservative justices alike signaled their concern that landowners could interfere with land remediation efforts ordered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Atlantic Richfield said the lower court’s decision could lead to the filing of thousands more lawsuits against companies nationwide, and further complicate federally mandated improvements to contaminated land. Atlantic Richfield, backed by President Donald Trump’s administration and industry lobby groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, has spent $450 million on soil and ground water restoration at the site ordered by the EPA. The Superfund program, started in 1980, is intended to identify contaminated sites and ensure that those responsible for the pollution pay for the hazardous waste cleanup. It has been criticized over the years for slow efforts. The case hinges on the scope of the Superfund law, called the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. The Anaconda smelter, near the small community of Opportunity, Montana, operated between 1884 and 1980 and provided much of the world’s copper supply. The area is filled with creeks and streams that cross forests and farmland. It was designated as a Superfund site in 1983 to reduce arsenic contamination in residential yards, pastures and ground water. Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts said that there could be “significant adverse impacts” from landowners taking actions that the EPA would oppose, noting the agency’s concerns about ground water in the Montana case. Liberal Justice Stephen Breyer said channeling efforts through the EPA would avoid “10,000 juries or 50 states” imposing conflicting duties. Much of the argument focused on whether each landowner was considered a “potentially responsible party” who must seek the EPA’s approval under the law before undertaking restoration of their own contaminated land. The case began in 2008 when the landowners sued in state court to restore their properties to pre-smelter conditions. Atlantic Richfield said such state law claims were barred by the EPA’s actions under the Superfund law. The company also said the litigation was prohibited by the U.S. Constitution’s so-called supremacy clause, which holds that federal law generally trumps state law.

Bakhtiyar Aslanbayli, BP’s vice president for Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, said the maintenance would take place in the second half of 2020. He said that maintenance shutdowns would take place at Chirag and Shah Deniz-Alfa platforms. A BP-led consortium produces oil at Azerbaijan’s giant Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) oilfield and natural gas - at the major Shah Deniz field. The Shah Deniz I field has been pumping gas since 2006, while output from Shah Deniz II is expected to reach 16 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas per year, with 10 bcm earmarked for Europe and 6 bcm for Turkey. Aslanbayli said the consortium planned to produce 16.6 bcm of gas at Shah Deniz this year. “Gas output will be rising, while oil production will be declining as expected,” he said, adding that peak gas output would be in 2022-2023. He said seismic works at bloc D-220 as well as drilling the first exploration well at the Shafag-Asiman gas field had been postponed to January next year due to bad weather conditions.

806,2019-12-19 00:00:00,2019,12.0,19,"Ron Bousso, Darya Korsunskaya, Dmitry Zhdannikov",Exclusive: BP's incoming CEO won't initially take up Rosneft board seat - company sources,"LONDON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Incoming Chief Executive Bernard Looney will not take up either of BP’s seats on the board of Rosneft when he takes over in February because of the complexity of the relationship with the Russian oil giant, five company sources said. Under an arrangement between Looney and outgoing Chief Executive Bob Dudley, Dudley will keep one of the seats when he retires in March, the sources said. Guillermo Quintero, a Venezuelan national who is also a former BP executive and has ties to the South American country’s national oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL], will keep the other seat, they said. The sources said Rosneft had been informed of the arrangement but did not say how long it was expected to last. BP owns nearly a fifth of Rosneft, its biggest foreign investment and the source of a third of its total output. But Looney has not worked in Russia and cannot rival 64-year-old Dudley’s long experience of working in and with the country and his deep ties with Rosneft, the Kremlin and Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Dudley will stay on the board of Rosneft because the relationship between BP and Moscow is very complicated,” a senior BP official told Reuters. Looney’s decision not to take either of the board seats has not been previously reported. Dudley said in October he would stay on the Rosneft board after retiring in March, but did not explain why. “With his unrivalled experience of both the international oil industry and Russia, Bob will continue to provide valuable experience on the Rosneft Board,” BP said in a statement to Reuters. Quintero’s ties to Venezuela are also important for Rosneft, as the Russian company became an important buyer of oil from the country after it was hit by sanctions by Washington. Rosneft did not reply to a written request for comment. Dudley is chairman of Rosneft’s strategic planning committee which focuses on long-term development and sustainability issues, according to Rosneft’s 2018 annual report. He and Quintero regularly take part in Rosneft board discussions and vote on topics ranging from long-term strategy to dividend payments to shareholders, including BP. It is unclear whether either will receive remuneration from BP for sitting on the Rosneft board. Neither Dudley nor Quintero hold shares in Rosneft and neither received remuneration from Rosneft last year, according to the 2018 annual report. Looney is taking the helm at BP at a time when oil companies are under pressure from investors to meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement and reduce carbon emissions from operations. The arrangement with Dudley will keep Looney at arm’s length from Rosneft and Russia. A Rosneft source said this could be beneficial for Looney as the United States and the European Union have imposed economic sanctions on Russia and Rosneft over Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. “From a sanctions point of view, the fact that BP’s new CEO will not be a board member is even good, allowing him to distance himself a bit (from Rosneft),” a senior source close to Rosneft said. “Dudley is trusted by BP, he is an insider. He is friends with (Rosneft CEO Igor) Sechin, too, which is good for Rosneft.” Dudley first worked in Russia in 1994 and was later CEO of TNK-BP, a joint venture with a group backed by four Russian oligarchs that turned sour - forcing Dudley at one time to flee Russia - but was eventually sold to Rosneft in 2011, giving BP a 19.75% stake in the oil giant and two board seats. He was pivotal in navigating BP’s Russian operations through the fallout from Crimea and his lobbying for Rosneft has helped serve BP’s interests. In a previously unreported letter dating from February 2019 seen by Reuters, Dudley asked Putin to grant Rosneft tax breaks to develop a major project in Russia. “Russian companies have limited opportunities to compete against U.S. producers and maintain their share of the global market,” Dudley wrote. His efforts complemented lobbying by Sechin and Russia’s energy minister to help Rosneft compete against other global oil producers, especially the expanding U.S. shale industry. Tax breaks would also help compensate Russian companies for any losses resulting from Russia’s participation since 2017 in a pact with OPEC to cut output, Dudley said in the letter. Dudley ended the letter with a request to grant tax incentives for the Priobskoye license block, which produces around 500,000 barrels of oil per day, or about 5% of Russia’s total. No decision has been taken yet. BP is a shale producer, and the letter was written about three months after BP completed the $10.5 billion purchase of U.S. shale assets from BHP. BP declined comment on the letter.

Murray Auchincloss, currently finance head of BP’s upstream division, will become BP’s chief financial officer on July 1, the company said on Tuesday. Gilvary has been credited with overseeing BP’s financial recovery following the 2010 deadly Gulf of Mexico oil spill which has cost the company more than $65 billion in fines, indemnities and clean up costs.

However, in October, Gilvary appeared to backtrack on a previous hint that the company would boost its dividend payouts, angering investors. His departure comes earlier than anticipated and as Looney, who will replace Bob Dudley as chief executive of BP after a decade, faces the tricky task of navigating the energy major through a rising tide of environmentalism and the move to a low-carbon economy. “Gilvary’s departure may be associated with a more significant change in the company’s strategy including its financial strategy as the running of BP moves to a new top team,” stockbroker Panmure Gordon said in a note. Panmure Gordon said Gilvary’s departure may also be associated with “problematic guidance over dividend”, a view which BP later rejected as “not true”. Gilvary, an avid triathlete who joined BP in 1986, will step down from the board on June 30. He is a non-executive director at Air Liquide (AIRP.PA), the Royal Navy Board and the Francis Crick Institute.

The deal with country’s petroleum regulator ANPG defines the terms for a risk-sharing contract on offshore oil block 18/15 and was signed on the sidelines of the UK-Africa Investment Summit on Monday. Outgoing BP Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley and his successor Bernard Looney attended the ceremony along with Angola’s minister of Mineral Resources and Petroleum, Diamantino Azevedo, and other top officials. BP is already a partner in ongoing production in Block 18, called the Greater Plutonio development. Last week, Italy’s Eni, France’s Total, Equinor and BP were awarded rights to develop several offshore blocks. Angola is working to reform its oil industry to halt a production slump that has dented the economy, including by privatizing stakes of state oil company Sonangol. BP and Angola signed a second agreement for the British major to support mine clearing efforts related to the southern Africa country’s 1975-2002 civil war “within the scope of social responsibility actions”, Angop said.

818,2020-01-21 00:00:00,2020,1.0,21,"Dmitry Zhdannikov, Ahmed Rasheed",Exclusive: BP pulls out of Iraq's Kirkuk field as expansion plans stall,"LONDON/BAGHDAD (Reuters) - BP (BP.L) has pulled out of Iraq’s giant Kirkuk oilfield after its $100 million exploration contract expired with no agreement on the field’s expansion, dealing a fresh blow to Iraq’s hopes to increase its oil output, three sources told Reuters. The move comes as Western energy companies reassess their operations in Iraq amid political turmoil following months of anti-government protests and a flare-up in tensions between the United States and Iran in the country. BP informed Iraqi authorities last month that it was pulling its staff out of the oilfield in the north of the country after its 2013 service contract expired at the end of 2019, the sources familiar with the matter said. A senior source at Iraq’s North Oil Company (NOC), which overseas the Kirkuk operations, confirmed BP’s withdrawal. “The results of its field study for Kirkuk oilfield development have been handed over to the North Oil Company and unfortunately it was below expectations ... at least for us,” the official said. “It’s very obvious study results were not encouraging for BP to extend its operations,” he added. The Iraqi government did not reply to a request for comment. BP confirmed it had completed the field work and studies and said it had handed its recommendations for the development of the field to the NOC. The London-based company did not comment on staff movements. “In 2013, BP signed a letter of intent (LOI) with the North Oil Company of the Iraq Ministry of Oil to support field activity studies in Kirkuk. As planned, in December 2019 BP completed field work, studies and recommendations,” it said. According to another senior NOC engineer, BP staff left their laptops with the NOC after completing the survey and technical study of the field. Iraq was hoping BP would help it triple output from the field to one million barrels per day (bpd) - more than a fifth of Iraq’s current production and one percent of global output.  But BP’s contract was put on hold in 2014 when the Iraqi army collapsed in the face of Islamic State’s sweeping advance in northern and western Iraq, allowing the Kurdish regional government (KRG) to take control of the Kirkuk region. Baghdad regained full control of the deposit from the regional government in 2017 after a failed Kurdish independence referendum, at which point BP resumed its studies on the field.  Kirkuk was discovered in 1927 and marks the birthplace of Iraq’s oil industry. BP and Iraq’s oil ministry signed in 2013 the letter of intent to study the development of the field with a planned spending of $100 million. BP’s work included a three-dimensional seismic study of the field’s reservoir to expand on the existing 2D data. Kirkuk is estimated to contain about nine billion barrels of recoverable oil, according to BP. Most of Iraq’s crude is produced from areas managed by the central government of Baghdad, in the south, and exported from southern ports on the Gulf. The KRG exports about 300,000 bpd of crude from northern Iraq through a pipeline across Turkey.

819,2020-01-22 00:00:00,2020,1.0,22,Ron Bousso,Exclusive: BP's Looney goes all-in on climate goals and explores overhaul,"LONDON (Reuters) - Change is afoot at BP. Incoming Chief Executive Bernard Looney plans to expand the company’s climate targets and is considering overhauling the structure of the oil and gas major in one of the biggest shake-ups in its 111-year history.  The 49-year-old Irishman plans to adopt broader carbon emissions reduction goals that will likely include emissions from fuels and products sold to customers rather than just the far lower emissions from BP’s own operations, according to four sources with knowledge of internal discussions with the new CEO. The aim is to catch up with, and possibly outdo, rivals such as Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Repsol (REP.MC) as investor pressure over climate change mounts, said the sources who declined to be named as the plans have not yet been made public. More stringent climate targets could lead to London-based BP (BP.L) selling its most carbon-intensive businesses such as oil and gas fields in Angola and Canada, they added. As part of the climate push, Looney is also looking at a broad reorganization of the company aimed at cutting costs, with one idea being explored to merge parts of the upstream oil and gas production division with refining and petrochemical operations, said five sources. The new CEO and his team of close advisers have held an intensive series of closed-door meetings in recent weeks to outline the new strategy, according to three of the sources. They said he would outline his “ambitions” for the company in a speech on Feb. 12, a week after he takes over from Bob Dudley. It is unclear if Looney has decided to adopt any structural changes at this stage. A BP spokesman declined to comment. Any new strategy will require a fine balancing act though, and is not without risk for a company whose pioneering efforts in the early 2000s to build a large renewables business, branded “Beyond Petroleum”, ended with huge losses. BP will have to rely on revenue from an expanding oil and gas business to fund its green ambitions while maintaining the generous dividends that keep investors on board. Some industry experts say that business model may not be sustainable in a low-carbon future. They also point out that BP’s emissions are rising, as its oil and gas exploration and production activity expands, while it spends just a fraction of its investment pot on renewables and low-carbon technologies. “Looney is coming in at a crucial moment for the oil sector,” said Morgan Stanley’s global oil analyst Martijn Rats. “Over the next decade, companies like BP will need to maintain supply of oil and gas, for which demand is continuing to grow. That will require ongoing investment. At the same time, they will need to prepare for a decarbonised future.” “All the while, their investors will ask them to keep up these large dividend payments. Balancing these three demands will be the key challenge.” Looney, who is known for his energetic management style, wants to go beyond the carbon reduction targets that were set by Dudley in 2019 and limited to emissions from BP’s own operations. The new targets will likely encompass, for the first time, emissions from the fuels and products sold, known as Scope 3, which account for nearly 90% of BP’s total emissions, according to the sources. BP’s current targets are to reduce emissions from its own operations to net zero by 2025, equivalent to cutting 3.5 million tonnes of CO2 compared with 2016. It also agreed in a resolution adopted by shareholders to align its business with the 2015 Paris climate agreement goals. It is not clear what reduction targets the company could set for its Scope 3 emissions. The goals are however expected to be detailed at a strategy day later this year, the sources said. Dudley, who became CEO almost a decade ago following the Deepwater Horizon rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico that drove BP to the brink of bankruptcy, had long resisted setting Scope 3 targets, arguing the company could not control how its fuels were being used. While Looney receives a financially solid company, he faces fierce pressure from shareholders and activists to do more to meet U.N.-backed goals to limit global warming. In Britain in particular, BP faces regular protests and calls for boycotts. Europe’s top oil firms have all set carbon reduction goals of various breadth. Scope 3 targets could align BP with its most climate-progressive rivals: Repsol, which aims become a net zero-carbon company by 2050; Shell which has set out an “ambition” to halve Scope 3 emissions by 2050; and Total (TOTF.PA). U.S. majors have lagged their European rivals, with Chevron setting limited reduction targets and ExxonMobil having no targets. See FACTBOX on oil majors’ climate goals: (GRAPHIC: BP's CO2 emissions - here) (GRAPHIC: Going green? - here) Looney, who joined BP in 1991 as a drilling engineer before rising through the ranks, is also considering overhauling the company’s traditional structure, aiming to reduce costs as the outlook for oil and gas prices and consumption remains uncertain. The idea being explored of merging parts of its upstream and downstream operations is driven by the fact that they share similar management objectives such as safety, cost efficiency and reduction of carbon emissions, according to the sources. Under the proposed changes, BP would also form a unit focused on its rapidly growing retail, marketing and power businesses. These businesses are expected to be central in the energy transition as customers switch to electric vehicles and global demand for electricity is set to soar in coming decades. Rival Shell has already carried out a major shake-up, in 2016, establishing its integrated gas division as a separate segment following the acquisition of BG Group which sharply expanded its liquefied natural gas business (LNG). France’s Total created a gas, renewables and power division in 2016 as it prepared to expand it LNG and low-carbon operations, spinning off parts of its upstream operations. Energy companies see natural gas as key for the energy transition, replacing more polluting coal in power generation. Since being announced as Dudley’s successor in October, Looney has shuttled around the world, visiting staff, partners and governments in BP’s main hubs, from India and Azerbaijan to Senegal. He has also met investors, consultants, bankers and environmental groups. “BP needs to be a willing and enthusiastic participant in the energy transition,” said Alasdair McKinnon, manager at The Scottish Investment Trust, which holds shares in the oil major. “But this needs to be balanced by the current reality of the economics of the low-carbon technologies” that are generally less profitable than oil and gas, he added. The numbers underline the challenge Looney could face in meeting more ambitious emissions goals. As things stand, BP’s upstream emissions are set to grow by 4% between 2018 and 2025 due to higher oil and gas production in the wake of the 2018 acquisition of BHP Billiton’s U.S. shale assets, HSBC said in a report, citing Wood Mackenzie data. However, of the roughly $16 billion per year the company invests in its business, only about $500 million goes to renewables and low-carbon technologies. BP, which made a profit of $7.4 billion in the first nine months of 2019, is also set to pay over $9 billion in dividend and share repurchases for the year. “Bernard knows that doing more of the same won’t win the day,” said a senior BP official. “He believes in oil and gas but is not blind to the consequences of using it and that it cannot last forever.” (GRAPHIC: BP's recovery - here) Reporting by Ron Bousso; Editing by Pravin Char",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-bp-exclusive/exclusive-bps-looney-goes-all-in-on-climate-goals-and-explores-overhaul-idUSKBN1ZL0MI,Environment,Reuters

Bernie Sanders, a top-tier 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a champion of the far left. ""They have a completely unrealistic idea of the complexity of the global energy system,"" Dudley told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""It's very complex."" Nearly a year ago, Ocasio-Cortez, with Sen. Ed Markey, released the Green New Deal, an ambitious plan to remake the U.S. economy and drastically reduce the nation's greenhouse gas emissions. Sanders, who endorsed the proposal, later released his own detailed plan, building on the Green New Deal and calling for the U.S. to move to renewable energy across the economy by 2050. Sanders later Wednesday responded on Twitter to Dudley's comments. ""What's 'unrealistic' is thinking we will let fossil fuel companies continue to destroy the planet. The outrageous greed of companies like BP got us into this crisis. We are going to solve the climate crisis, end their greed and hold them accountable for the damage they caused,"" Sanders tweeted. The office of Ocasio-Cortez did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment. Dudley on Wednesday did not entirely shoot down the need for energy transition. He stressed that ""we must reduce carbon emissions"" and that ""renewables need to grow."" But he said there's other factors to be considered. ""The world needs all forms of energy,"" he said. ""Less emissions, but all forms of energy."" Industry executives have been focused on sustainability issues this week in Davos and around the global. The theme at this year's annual WEF in the Swiss Alps is ""stakeholders for a cohesive and sustainable world."" Days before the forum opened, BlackRock chief Larry Fink called on industry leaders to prepare for a long-term climate crisis that will reshape finance. Fink, whose BlackRock surpassed $7 trillion in assets under management, used his annual letter to the world's biggest companies to sound the alarm. ""Climate change has become a defining factor in companies' long-term prospects. … But awareness is rapidly changing, and I believe we are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance."" BlackRock will put ""sustainability at the center of our investment approach,"" he wrote — from portfolio construction to launching new investment products that screen fossil fuels. Dudley said he spoke with Fink on Tuesday. Fink explained, according to Dudley, that the letter was not a call to ""get out of hydrocarbons."" Dudley said Fink ""made that clear."" In November, Dudley told CNBC that there was a lack of realism from environmentalists and lawmakers who want the energy industry to immediately stop carbon-emitting activity. ""There's just a lot of people, very well-meaning people, who want to believe that there is a simple solution,"" Dudley said at the Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition & Conference. He said that natural gas, which emits roughly half of the carbon as coal to produce the same level of energy, needed to be a big part of the energy transition story. He said fast-developing technology to monitor gas leakage, such as satellite imagery and drone inspection, would soon help to reduce waste further. Dudley will be stepping down on Feb. 4 as CEO and from the board. He's the company's longest-serving chief executive, with nearly a decade at the helm. He will retire at the end of March. — CNBC's David Reid contributed to this report.",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/22/bp-ceo-hits-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-bernie-sanders-on-green-new-deal.html,,CNBC

The U.K.-based oil and gas company posted full-year underlying replacement cost profit, used as a proxy for net profit, of $10 billion in 2019. That compared with $12.7 billion full-year net profit in 2018, reflecting a year-on-year fall of 21%. Analysts had expected full-year net profit to come in at $9.7 billion in 2019, according to data from Refinitiv. Shares of BP were up more than 4%. ""BP is performing well, with safe and reliable operations, continued strategic progress and strong cash delivery,"" Bob Dudley, CEO of BP, said in a statement. ""After almost ten years, this is now my last quarter as CEO. In that time, we have achieved a huge amount together and I am proud to be handing over a safer and stronger BP to Bernard and his team."" ""I am confident that under their leadership, BP will continue to successfully navigate the rapidly-changing energy landscape,"" Dudley said.

In October, Dudley announced he would step down as CEO on Feb. 4., having held the position for almost a decade. The 64-year-old plans to retire on March 31, thus bringing an end to his 40-year career with BP. The energy giant's full-year results follow disappointing earnings from oil and gas companies on both sides of the Atlantic.

France's Total is scheduled to report its latest quarterly earnings on Feb. 6. International benchmark Brent crude traded at $54.74 Tuesday lunchtime, up more than 0.5%, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) stood at $50.75, around 1.2% higher. Both crude benchmarks have each fallen around 20% since climbing to a peak in early January, dragged lower by concern over demand in China after the coronavirus outbreak. Brian Gilvary, chief financial officer at BP, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday that the coronavirus outbreak could wipe out as much as 300,000 to 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil demand in 2020. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has previously said it expects oil demand to grow by 1.2 million bpd this year, so a reduction of up to 500,000 bpd would leave demand growth ""healthy"" at 700,000 to 800,000 bpd, Gilvary said. ""I think, in terms of price direction, all roads will then lead to what OPEC will do in terms of trying to rebalance the system to get back to something around $60 to $65 a barrel,"" he added. OPEC and its allies are considering cutting their oil output by a further 500,000 bpd this year, two OPEC sources and a third industry source familiar with discussions told Reuters on Monday.

Erginbilgic, who joined BP in 1997, oversaw the expansion of the downstream business, which includes refining, retail and petrochemicals, into electric vehicle charging and added thousands of petrol stations in developing economies such as India and Mexico. The announcement on his departure comes two days after Looney took the helm from Bob Dudley. It follows Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary’s decision to leave the company in June. Looney’s successor as head of upstream has yet to be announced. Erginbilgic’s successor will be announced separately, BP said. “Under Tufan’s leadership, BP’s Downstream has been at the heart of our return to growth; what he has achieved in this time is extraordinary,” Looney said in a statement. Downstream helped boost BP’s profit after the 2014 oil price collapse, offsetting weaker revenue from the larger oil and gas production division. The expansion in retail and petrochemicals are seen as key for BP as the world shifts away from fossil fuels, focusing on low-carbon fuels and plastics whose demand BP expects to continue growing sharply in the coming decades.

839,2020-02-04 00:00:00,2020,2.0,4,Ron Bousso,BP boosts dividend as profit tops forecast and CEO bows out,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP (BP.L) raised its dividend and said it had completed a $1.5 billion share buyback program in a sign of confidence in its growing oil and gas business on the last day in office for Chief Executive Bob Dudley. BP shares were trading 4.5% higher at 1115 GMT on Tuesday, on course for their biggest daily gain in over a year after the company’s profit beat forecasts for a twelfth quarter in a row. As Bernard Looney prepares to take the helm, BP struck a positive tone even as oil prices slumped to a near year-low on concerns over China’s coronavirus, bucking a trend among peers that saw a sharp slowdown in revenues last week. The shareholder rewards came as the London-based company reported a 26% drop in fourth-quarter profit, which easily beat forecasts, and $2.7 billion in charges. Cash flow rose by more than 10% in 2019 to $25.8 billion, despite lower commodity prices, as a result of higher production - particularly in U.S. shale following the acquisition of BHP assets. Still, BP’s debt-to-capital ratio, known as gearing, rose by the end of 2019 from a year earlier, even though BP sold $9.4 billion of assets, underlying the strain oil companies face as demand for fuels and chemicals weakened last year. “Solid delivery in a tough environment,” Redburn analyst Stuart Joyner concluded in a note, adding the focus would be on reducing debt. Rivals ExxonMobil (XOM.N), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Chevron (CVX.N) reported sharp drops in 2019 revenues due to softer demand, particularly in Asia. (Graphic: Oil majors' cashflows, here) (Graphic: BP cashflow 2019, here) Dudley, 64, bows out after a decade at BP’s helm. He was abruptly ushered in as CEO in October 2010 after his predecessor Tony Hayward stepped down in the wake of the deadly Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico. He has since led the company through a deep and long downturn and rising pressure from investors to adapt to the transition to more renewable energy. Looney, who takes over on Wednesday, is planning to expand BP’s climate targets and is considering a major overhaul to the structure of the 111-year-old company. “I am proud to be handing over a safer and stronger BP to Bernard and his team. I am confident that under their leadership, BP will continue to successfully navigate the rapidly-changing energy landscape,” Dudley said in a statement. BP reported $2.57 billion in fourth-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, its definition of net income, exceeding analysts’ forecast of $2.1 billion in a company-provided poll. That was down from $3.5 billion a year earlier, but up from $2.3 billion in the third quarter. The results were driven by a lower tax rate and stronger-than-expected performance of the oil and gas production unit, or upstream, which saw output rise in 2019 by 3.8% to 2.64 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, driven by a doubling of output from U.S. shale oil following the $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP’s assets in late 2018. (Graphic: BP quarterly profits, here) Refining profits dropped by a third in the fourth quarter to $1.44 billion due to a weaker performance of BP’s large oil trading business. “Our oil trading result was not as strong as the previous quarters even if it had a record year overall,” Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary, who steps down in June, told Reuters. BP raised its dividend by 2.4% to 10.5 cents per share, the second increase since the BHP acquisition. BP also denied media reports it was considering selling its 10.75% stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft (ROSN.MM). “Rosneft is one of our closest strategic partners,” Gilvary said.

840,2020-02-06 00:00:00,2020,2.0,6,"Ron Bousso, Dmitry Zhdannikov",Exclusive: BP eyes sale of Algerian gas plant after Rosneft talks fail - sources,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP (BP.L) is seeking buyers for its stake in a major Algerian gas plant deep in the Sahara desert after recent talks on a sale to Russian oil giant Rosneft (ROSN.MM) failed, three industry sources told Reuters. BP hopes to raise around $2 billion from the sale of its 45.89% stake in the In Amenas natural gas plant that was the target of a deadly attack by Islamist militants in 2013. The sale is part of a $15 billion disposal programme BP is targeting by the middle of 2021, two of the sources said. The approval of a sale of the Algerian assets will be one of the first major decisions for Chief Executive Bernard Looney who took office on Wednesday after his predecessor Bob Dudley stepped down following a decade at the helm. The sale is politically sensitive for BP and its partners, Norway’s Equinor (EQNR.OL) and Algerian state-owned Sonatrach, in the wake of the January 2013 attacks when gunmen raided the site and 40 employees died after a four-day siege. A BP spokesman declined to comment. Equinor and Sonatrach declined to comment. Rosneft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. BP has in recent months contacted a number of major international oil and gas companies to test the appetite for the stake after talks with Rosneft failed last year, the sources said. The collapse in the discussions with Rosneft, in which BP itself holds a 19.75% stake, were partly a result of Equinor’s reluctance to partner with the Russian company, which faces U.S. sanctions, the sources who were close to the discussions said. BP and Equinor in December 2017 signed a five-year extension agreement for the In Amenas production sharing agreement with Sonatrach which was ratified in April 2018. Equinor holds a 45.9% stake and Sonatrach has the remaining 8.21% of the In Amenas plant, which has a production capacity is 9 billion cubic meters per year. The plant produced around 46,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018. Security at Algeria’s southern oil and gas facilities has improved in recent years due to a boosted military presence. In 2016, BP and Equinor temporarily withdrew staff from the In Amenas and In Salah gas plants after an attack on In Salah. An investigation carried out in 2013 by Equinor, known then as Statoil, concluded that the operators of the In Amenas site did not have the necessary security measures. BP has sold nearly $10 billion of oil and gas assets around the world since the start of 2019 and expects to announce an additional $5 billion by the middle of 2021, it said on Tuesday. The disposals follow BP’s $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP’s U.S. shale oil and gas assets and are part of a drive to focus BP’s operations on higher profit assets in regions such as the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil.

We all want energy that is reliable and affordable, but that is no longer enough,"" CEO Bernard Looney said in a statement. ""It must also be cleaner,"" he added. ""To deliver that, trillions of dollars will need to be invested in replumbing and rewiring the world’s energy system. It will require nothing short of reimagining energy as we know it."" The company has set five directives to help it reach the 2050 goal. Notably, BP wants to slash its carbon and methane intensity by 50 percent and invest more in “non-oil and gas businesses.” Looney said BP will be reorganized into 11 teams, with the leaders of these new departments managing the company. “Our historic structure has served us well but, in order to keep up with rapidly-evolving customer demands and society’s expectations, we need to become more integrated and more focused,” Looney explained. “So we are undertaking a major reorganisation, introducing a new structure, a new leadership team and new ways of working for all of us.” BP Chairman Helge Lund said in the release that Looney has the full support of the board and that “net zero is not only the right thing for BP, it is the right thing for our shareholders and for society more broadly.” Also reworked is the company’s mission statement: “Reimagining energy for people and our planet.” Both Looney and Lund expressed confidence that the ambitious changes would not affect BP’s ability to carry out its responsibilities to both consumers and stakeholders. Between greenhouse gases and carbon, BP currently emits approximately 415 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent a year. Updated at 2:08 p.m. View the discussion thread.

Hundreds of anti-oil activists occupied the British Museum last Friday to protest the oil company British Petroleum (BP)’s sponsorship of one of the museum’s current exhibitions, Troy: Myth and Reality. Members of the theatrical activist group BP Or Not BP? brought a four-meter model of a Trojan Horse emblazoned with the BP logo to the museum and stationed it in the courtyard for the protest, which lasted 51 hours. Citing Chile’s “social unrest,” the Chilean Ministry of Culture has declined an invitation from ARCOmadrid, Spain’s major contemporary art fair, to participate as the guest country in its 2021 edition. The decision has been viewed as a heavy blow to the nation’s artistic community and a means of silencing artists who could air the government’s human rights transgressions abroad.

851,2020-02-14 00:00:00,2020,2.0,14,Dino Grandoni,The Energy 202: Pressure is on Exxon and Chevron after BP makes major climate pledge,"THE LIGHTBULB The biggest British petroleum producer just set one of the most ambitious climate goals of any major multinational oil-and-gas company. Now the pressure is on its American counterparts to do the same.  On Wednesday, BP said it will try to slash its own greenhouse gas emissions from the production and use of its gasoline, jet fuel and other products. Its goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by the middle of the century follows similar pledges from other European oil majors, including Royal Dutch Shell and Repsol. Though BP was short on details about how it will hit that ambitious mark, its announcement is a coup for investors and activists putting pressure on corporations to confront a dire and looming environmental crisis. Now their attention is turning to ExxonMobil and Chevron, the two largest oil companies in the United States. “They were laggards before and they're now further behind than they were a month or two ago,” said Andrew Logan, a senior director at Ceres, a sustainability nonprofit organization pressing companies to address climate change. So far, the two big U.S. petroleum producers have only committed to trimming emissions from drilling, refining and transporting their products — not from their use in automobiles or at power plants. But those operational emissions account for only a fraction of any oil companies' overall contribution to rising temperatures worldwide. Neither Exxon nor Chevron replied to a request for comment.  That's what makes BP's commitment noteworthy: It includes end-use emissions in its climate targets. The company plans to still produce oil and gas by 2050, but that would require major breakthroughs in technologies that capture carbon dioxide before it reaches the atmosphere. Those carbon-capture technologies are still in development and are not yet financially feasible.  BP's pledge, Logan said, “expands the scope of what's seen as possible for what an oil company can do.” The announcement is one of the first moves made by Bernard Looney, BP’s new chief executive, who started the job earlier this month. The news comes as big Wall Street banks are under greater pressure than ever to withhold financing from fossil-fuel projects. In a note to investors, one of those financial institutions, HSBC, called BP's pledge “potentially a game-changer for the company and the industry.” ExxonMobil and Chevron have made their fair share of pledges when it comes to climate change. In a break with President Trump, a staunch ally of the U.S. oil sector, both companies support placing a tax on carbon emissions and agreed with the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which seeks to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. Trump has pulled the United States out of the Paris accord. Exxon, too, says it supports having some sort of federal regulation on the release of methane, another greenhouse gas, from oil and gas facilities. The Trump administration has rolled back methane rules put in place under President Barack Obama. But Exxon has otherwise resisted overtures from activist investors to tackle climate change more aggressively. Last year, Exxon persuaded the Securities and Exchange Commission to block a proposal urging the company to adopt and disclose greenhouse gas targets aligned with the Paris accord. So why have European oil companies been more ambitious in their climate pledges than major U.S. firms? Kathy Mulvey, an accountability campaign director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, chalked up that transatlantic gap to oil companies facing greater pressure from European lawmakers to act on climate change. “At the national level in Europe,” she said, “there's more happening.”  — EPA releases new environmental enforcement data: The agency yesterday revealed new numbers on how vigorously it enforced environmental law through the 12-month period ending September 2019.

852,2020-02-12 15:20:49,2020,2.0,12,Brad Plumer,BP Pledges to Cut Emissions to Zero but Offers Few Details,"The British oil giant BP set the most ambitious climate change goal of any major oil company on Wednesday, saying that it aimed to eliminate or offset by 2050 all of the planet-warming emissions from its operations — as well as the emissions caused by the burning of the oil and gas it pumps out of the ground. The company provided few details on how, exactly, it would achieve that difficult feat. But the pledge is another sign that major companies, including fossil-fuel producers, are facing growing pressure from investors and activists to show they are taking global warming seriously. “We are aiming to earn back the trust of society,” said Bernard Looney, BP’s chief executive, at a news conference in London. “We have got to change, and change profoundly.” Rising concerns about climate change pose an existential threat for oil and gas companies, since scientists have said that preventing dangerous temperature increases will require steep reductions in the use of fossil fuels. In recent years, shareholders have pressed oil companies to prepare for a future in which countries shift to electric vehicles or enact new regulations to limit carbon dioxide emissions. Other European oil companies — including Royal Dutch Shell, Total and Equinor — have already adopted targets to curb their emissions. But BP is going further, pledging to also zero out the emissions associated with the oil and gas it pumps out of the ground and sells. That last step is both the hardest and most significant, since it is where oil companies have an outsize climate impact. BP said that the company emits about 55 million tons of greenhouse gases each year directly from its extraction operations and refineries. But an additional 360 million tons each year are emitted when the oil and gas that BP extracts is sold and eventually burned to fuel vehicles or heat homes. To put that in context, the entire state of California produced 424 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions in 2017. To shrink the emissions that come from the use of its products, BP may have to reduce the amount of oil and gas that it extracts, develop lower-carbon fuels such as those made from algae or plants, or offset its fuel emissions through steps like planting trees or investing in still-nascent technology to suck carbon dioxide out of the air. Mr. Looney said in a statement that BP would begin laying out a more detailed strategy in September. The announcement came with a caveat: BP isn’t currently planning to zero out emissions from oil and gas extracted by other companies and then processed by BP and resold. The burning of those fuels creates an additional 77 million tons or so of emissions each year, the company said. Instead, BP will aim to cut the carbon intensity — the amount of emissions per unit of energy — from these products in half by 2050. That falls slightly short of the target set by the Spanish oil company Repsol, which in December set a net zero goal for all of the products it produces and sells. But Repsol is a much smaller oil company than BP. Some environmental groups offered cautious praise for BP’s pledge, though they said they would need to see more details and concrete actions. But other green groups said they would not consider BP serious about climate change until it made a commitment to stop expanding its extraction of fossil fuels. “Unless BP commits clearly to stop searching for more oil and gas, and to keep their existing reserves in the ground, we shouldn’t take a word of their P.R. spin seriously,” said Ellen Gibson, a campaigner for fossil-fuel divestment with the environmental group 350.org in Britain. At the news conference, Mr. Looney said he expected BP would still be producing oil and gas by 2050, though he added that he expected oil production to “decline over time.” Mr. Looney also said BP planned to push governments to enact stricter climate policies, such as a tax on the carbon dioxide emitted by companies. But it remains to be seen how aggressively BP will pursue this strategy. In 2018, under its previous leadership, BP spent $13 million lobbying against a ballot initiative in Washington State that would have imposed a statewide carbon tax, saying that the policy would set a “bad precedent.” Mr. Looney, who took over as BP’s chief executive in February, signaled he wanted to take the company in a new direction. He vowed to end a corporate advertising campaign that critics called greenwashing and said the company would review its membership in trade associations that opposed stricter climate policies.

853,2020-02-12 00:00:00,2020,2.0,12,,Algeria says BP did not ask to sell its In Amenas gas stake,"ALGIERS (Reuters) - BP has written to Algeria to express its interest in investing in its oil sector and has not made any request to sell its shares in the In Amenas gas plant, state news agency APS quoted Energy Minister Mohamed Arkab as saying on Wednesday. Reuters last week reported three industry sources as saying that BP Plc was seeking buyers for its stake in the gas plant, deep in the Sahara desert, after recent talks on a sale to Russian oil giant Rosneft failed. “BP did not send any request to sell its shares in Tiguentourine’s plant in Amenas,” APS reported Arkab as saying in the first official comment on the report in Algeria. The sources said BP hopes to raise around $2 billion from the sale of its 45.89% stake in In Amenas, the target of a deadly attack by Islamist militants in 2013. The sale is part of a $15 billion disposal program BP is targeting by the middle of 2021, two of the sources said. Algeria relies on energy export revenue for a large chunk of its state budget and foreign currency earnings, but production and sales have been falling for several years. In December it passed a law aimed at making it easier for international energy companies to invest in the hydrocarbons industry in the hopes of boosting output, though it kept a bar on majority foreign ownership of projects in the sector.

854,2020-02-12 00:00:00,2020,2.0,12,"Ron Bousso, Shadia Nasralla",BP boss Looney sets out to 'reinvent' oil giant with zero carbon goal,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP set one of the oil sector’s most ambitious targets for curbing carbon emissions on Wednesday as new chief executive Bernard Looney began the biggest revamp in its 111-year history. While investor groups welcomed the 2050 targets set out by Looney, which put BP ahead of rivals Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), Total (TOTF.PA), Equinor (EQNR.OL) and all of the U.S. oil majors, environmental campaigners criticized a lack of detail. “We have got to change and change profoundly because the world is changing fast and so are society’s expectations of us,” Looney said in his first major speech as CEO, after earlier highlighting a need to “reinvent BP”. “It is aiming to reduce and neutralize the carbon in the oil and gas that we dig out of the ground,” Looney added. BP did not say how it intends to get emissions from its operations and barrels produced to net zero and halve the intensity of emissions by all products it sells, including diesel and petrol, a measure known as Scope 3. The company has tried, and failed, to reinvent itself before, with a pioneering plan to build a large renewables business in the early 2000s which ended with huge losses. One possible way to hit greenhouse gas reduction targets is to buy offset certificates and bet on carbon capture and storage technology, which is not yet used on a commercial scale. But Charlie Kronick, Oil Advisor from Greenpeace UK, was skeptical about how BP can deliver. “How will they reach net zero ... When will they stop wasting billions on drilling for new oil and gas we can’t burn?” Shares in BP were up 1.3% at 1423 GMT, roughly in line with the broader European energy sector index .SXEP after the news, which confirmed a Reuters report in January. The world’s top oil and gas companies are under heavy pressure from investors and climate activists to meet the 2015 Paris climate goal of limiting global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels. U.S. groups such as Exxon (XOM.N), Chevron (CVX.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) are far less ambitious with their greenhouse gas reduction targets than their European rivals. Stephanie Pfeifer, a member of the global Climate Action 100+ Steering Committee and CEO of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change welcomed BP’s plan. “Building on the positive engagement with BP ... investors will continue to look for progress from the company in addressing climate change. This includes how it will invest more in non-oil and gas businesses,” she said in a statement. BP’s absolute net zero carbon target relates to every barrel it produces, based on its equity stake in oil and gas fields, from the well to the petrol station. It does not encompass oil products which BP markets, but does not produce itself. BP, which produced around 2.64 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2019, said it would cut emissions to net zero from some 415 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year. Near term plans will be published by a September investor day, Looney said, adding BP is likely to produce fewer barrels by 2050. “We welcome BP’s recognition of the reality we now live in but 2050 is too late,” a spokeswoman for climate change activist group Extinction Rebellion said. (Graphic: Oil majors' carbon emissions png - here) Anglo-Dutch group Shell has set Scope 3 targets based on intensity rather than on absolute reduction terms. Intensity-based targets measure the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per unit of energy or barrel of oil and gas produced. That means that absolute emissions can rise with growing production, even if the headline intensity metric falls. Scope 3 emissions vastly exceed greenhouse gases caused by the production of crude oil, natural gas and refined products, including electricity generation, typically by a factor of about six among oil majors, according to Reuters calculations. BP will also set “new expectations” for relationships with trade organisations and be ready to quit if they are not aligned. Last year, BP invested around $500 million in low-carbon technologies including wind power, electric vehicle battery charging systems and solar power firm Lightsource BP. That compared to an overall budget of $15.2 billion in 2019. In perhaps its biggest-ever corporate shake-up, BP will dismantle the traditional model of an oil and gas production, or upstream, unit and a refining, trading and marketing, or downstream, unit to “become more integrated and more focused”. A new production and operations unit, which includes oil and gas production as well as refining and chemicals, will be led by Gordon Birrell. Meanwhile, customers and products will be led by Emma Delaney, gas and low carbon energy by Dev Sanyal and innovation and engineering by David Eyton.

Chief Executive Karl Johnny Hersvik said the company planned to continue to grow both via acquisitions and by discovering and developing new oil and gas finds off Norway. However, he said it was losing faith in the prospects of the Barents Sea in the Arctic, once seen as the most promising area for new oil and gas finds off Norway. “Data shows it’s not as prolific as we thought before. We see better return on capital employed towards exploration elsewhere on the Norwegian continental shelf,” Hersvik told Reuters on the sidelines of an earnings presentation during the company’s capital markets day. Shares in Aker BP were up 1.5% at 1417 GMT, outperforming a 1.4% rise in European oil stocks .SXEP, after the company reported a 13% rise in profit for the final quarter of 2019. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose to $745 million in the quarter, from $658 million a year earlier and beating analysts’ forecast for $740.6 million, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Aker BP said it would cut capital expenditure to $1.5 billion this year, from $1.67 billion in 2019 when investments in Johan Sverdrup were high. The company, jointly controlled by oil major BP (BP.L) and Norwegian investment firm Aker (AKER.OL), sees its production rising to 205,000-220,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) in 2020 from 155,900 boed last year. It still plans to drill four wells in the Barents Sea this year, including one operated well in a block bordering Russia. The company said it was in “a good and constructive” dialogue with its partners, including Equinor (EQNR.OL), on how to develop a number of discoveries in the so-called NOAKA area, estimated to hold more than 500 million boe in recoverable resources. Hersvik said he hoped to reach an agreement by the end of this year. Aker BP has an 11.6% stake in Sverdrup, Western Europe’s biggest oilfield, which began production in October. The company said the field could ramp up its output to the Phase 1 capacity of 440,000 barrels before this summer. “I believe we can improve Johan Sverdrup further as we did with our other assets,” said Kjetil Digre, Aker BP’s head of operations. The company also said it plans to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions’ intensity this year to less than five kilograms of CO2 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe), from 7 kg in the fourth quarter of last year.

Reuters last week reported three industry sources as saying that BP Plc was seeking buyers for its stake in the gas plant, deep in the Sahara desert, after recent talks on a sale to Russian oil giant Rosneft failed. “BP did not send any request to sell its shares in Tiguentourine’s plant in Amenas,” APS reported Arkab as saying in the first official comment on the report in Algeria.

The sale is part of a $15 billion disposal program BP is targeting by the middle of 2021, two of the sources said. Algeria relies on energy export revenue for a large chunk of its state budget and foreign currency earnings, but production and sales have been falling for several years.

860,2020-02-12 00:00:00,2020,2.0,12,George Hay,Breakingviews - BP leaves investors in a better sort of limbo,"LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Bernard Looney is shifting BP investors to a better sort of limbo. The oil giant’s new chief executive on Wednesday set out long-awaited ambitions to mostly eliminate carbon emissions. That puts BP at the front of the industry pack but keeps investors largely in the dark for now. Looney’s targets position BP alongside Spain’s Repsol and slightly ahead of arch-rival Royal Dutch Shell in the climate awareness stakes. The Anglo-Dutch giant has an ambition to halve the volume of greenhouse gases emitted per unit of energy it produces by 2050, while the Spanish group has said it will reduce net emissions to zero by that date. Both companies are more enlightened than most U.S. rivals. But Repsol’s pledge to eliminate emissions is more in line with the overall goal to restrict global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Shell’s measure could in theory allow it to keep producing more carbon dioxide. BP’s proposal is to not only cut 55 million tonnes of carbon spewed out by its own operations every year to zero. It also aims to do the same with 360 million tonnes created annually when customers burn the company’s refined products, for example in petrol-powered cars. Like Repsol, Looney is not proposing to cancel out emissions from oil that BP buys from other producers to use in its refineries. Given that the British company used to argue that its customers’ emissions weren’t its problem, Looney has taken a tangible step forward. It’s also necessary. As companies face ever-stiffer disclosure requirements on climate change risk, targets for shrinking emissions are vital to prevent poor environmental ratings that could prompt investors to shun BP shares. Those investors still don’t know how BP will hit its target, though. Looney says the company’s oil production will decline over time, but has given no timescale. BP could cut its emissions by investing more in utility assets and renewable energy – but these tend to generate lower returns than pumping oil. Alternatively, the company might be counting on still-to-be-developed technology to capture and store carbon dioxide after it has been burned. Shareholders trying to work out the 95 billion pound company’s future value will have to wait until later for more clarity.

866,2020-02-12 00:00:00,2020,2.0,12,"Ron Bousso, Shadia Nasralla",BP boss Looney sets out to 'reinvent' oil giant with zero carbon goal,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP set one of the oil sector’s most ambitious targets for curbing carbon emissions on Wednesday as new chief executive Bernard Looney began the biggest revamp in its 111-year history. While investor groups welcomed the 2050 targets set out by Looney, which put BP ahead of rivals Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), Total (TOTF.PA), Equinor (EQNR.OL) and all of the U.S. oil majors, environmental campaigners criticized a lack of detail. “We have got to change and change profoundly because the world is changing fast and so are society’s expectations of us,” Looney said in his first major speech as CEO, after earlier highlighting a need to “reinvent BP”. “It is aiming to reduce and neutralize the carbon in the oil and gas that we dig out of the ground,” Looney added. BP did not say how it intends to get emissions from its operations and barrels produced to net zero and halve the intensity of emissions by all products it sells, including diesel and petrol, a measure known as Scope 3. The company has tried, and failed, to reinvent itself before, with a pioneering plan to build a large renewables business in the early 2000s which ended with huge losses. One possible way to hit greenhouse gas reduction targets is to buy offset certificates and bet on carbon capture and storage technology, which is not yet used on a commercial scale. But Charlie Kronick, Oil Advisor from Greenpeace UK, was skeptical about how BP can deliver. “How will they reach net zero ... When will they stop wasting billions on drilling for new oil and gas we can’t burn?” Shares in BP were up 1.3% at 1423 GMT, roughly in line with the broader European energy sector index .SXEP after the news, which confirmed a Reuters report in January. The world’s top oil and gas companies are under heavy pressure from investors and climate activists to meet the 2015 Paris climate goal of limiting global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels. U.S. groups such as Exxon (XOM.N), Chevron (CVX.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) are far less ambitious with their greenhouse gas reduction targets than their European rivals. Stephanie Pfeifer, a member of the global Climate Action 100+ Steering Committee and CEO of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change welcomed BP’s plan. “Building on the positive engagement with BP ... investors will continue to look for progress from the company in addressing climate change. This includes how it will invest more in non-oil and gas businesses,” she said in a statement. BP’s absolute net zero carbon target relates to every barrel it produces, based on its equity stake in oil and gas fields, from the well to the petrol station. It does not encompass oil products which BP markets, but does not produce itself. BP, which produced around 2.64 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2019, said it would cut emissions to net zero from some 415 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year. Near term plans will be published by a September investor day, Looney said, adding BP is likely to produce fewer barrels by 2050. “We welcome BP’s recognition of the reality we now live in but 2050 is too late,” a spokeswoman for climate change activist group Extinction Rebellion said. (Graphic: Oil majors' carbon emissions png - here) Anglo-Dutch group Shell has set Scope 3 targets based on intensity rather than on absolute reduction terms. Intensity-based targets measure the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per unit of energy or barrel of oil and gas produced. That means that absolute emissions can rise with growing production, even if the headline intensity metric falls. Scope 3 emissions vastly exceed greenhouse gases caused by the production of crude oil, natural gas and refined products, including electricity generation, typically by a factor of about six among oil majors, according to Reuters calculations. BP will also set “new expectations” for relationships with trade organisations and be ready to quit if they are not aligned. Last year, BP invested around $500 million in low-carbon technologies including wind power, electric vehicle battery charging systems and solar power firm Lightsource BP. That compared to an overall budget of $15.2 billion in 2019. In perhaps its biggest-ever corporate shake-up, BP will dismantle the traditional model of an oil and gas production, or upstream, unit and a refining, trading and marketing, or downstream, unit to “become more integrated and more focused”. A new production and operations unit, which includes oil and gas production as well as refining and chemicals, will be led by Gordon Birrell. Meanwhile, customers and products will be led by Emma Delaney, gas and low carbon energy by Dev Sanyal and innovation and engineering by David Eyton.

Both ACG and Shah Deniz are operated by international consortiums led by BP and provide significant revenue for the former Soviet country, though BP has had to work hard in recent years to counter ACG’s dwindling reserves. A BP-led consortium last week said that it produced an average of 535,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil at ACG last year, totaling 26 million tonnes, down slightly from 584,000 bpd, or 29 million tonnes, in 2018. Natural gas from the Shah Deniz offshore field was 16.8 billion cubic meters (bcm) and condensate output was 3.5 million tonnes, up from 11.5 bcm of gas and 2.5 million tonnes of condensate in 2018. “Both gas and condensate production will continue to ramp up,” Bakhtiyar Aslanbayli, BP’s vice president for Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, told Reuters. He said that daily production and Shah Deniz’s Alfa platform was 22.5 million cubic meters (mcm) and “this will remain stable”, while the field’s Bravo platform had been producing 33.5 mcm per day and “this will continue to ramp up throughout the year”. Aslanbayli said the consortium’s drilling at Shah Deniz II would extend for the next few years until production reaches a plateau of 16 bcm of gas and 120,000 bpd of condensate. BP continues works on slowing the natural decline at ACG, which is currently off plateau, and Aslanbayli said that the new $6 billion Azeri Central East (ACE) project will help to offset lower output from ACG. “The new platform will be technically advanced and will use automation to drive efficiency,” he said. Aslanbayli said that ACE is expected to deliver about 300 million barrels of oil by 2049. He said that BP’s other projects in Azerbaijan in 2020 include ongoing exploration drilling at the Shafag-Asiman offshore block as well as 3D seismic acquisition on block D-230 and plans to begin drilling at the Shallow Water Absheron Peninsula (SWAP) exploration area.

868,2020-02-12 00:00:00,2020,2.0,12,,Oil giant BP says it wants to have net-zero emissions by 2050,"Oil and gas major BP said Wednesday it was aiming to become ""a net zero company by 2050 or sooner,"" adding that it also wanted to ""help the world get to net zero."" In an announcement detailing its plans, BP listed a number of aims it had for the business. These included: Cutting the carbon intensity of products it sells by 50% by 2050 or earlier; installing methane measurement at its major oil and gas processing sites by the year 2023 and halving the methane intensity of operations; and upping the proportion of its investment in non-oil and gas businesses. In order to push the world toward net zero, BP said it would undertake actions such as ""more active advocacy"" for policies supportive of net zero, like carbon pricing. ""The world's carbon budget is finite and running out fast; we need a rapid transition to net zero,"" new CEO Bernard Looney said in a statement. ""We all want energy that is reliable and affordable, but that is no longer enough,"" he added. ""It must also be cleaner. To deliver that, trillions of dollars will need to be invested in replumbing and rewiring the world's energy system. It will require nothing short of reimagining energy as we know it."" BP said its goal to be a net-zero business covered, on an absolute basis, greenhouse gas emissions from global operations as well as the carbon in the oil and gas it generates. ""This is what we mean by making BP net zero,"" Looney said. ""It directly addresses all the carbon we get out of the ground as well as all the greenhouse gases we emit from our operations. These will be absolute reductions, which is what the world needs."" A note from Wells Fargo Securities' Equity Research group described BP's move as a ""modestly positive event"" for the company. ""By directly addressing the ESG elephant-in-the-room with a clear forward path BP may see a greater universe of potential investors willing to kick the tires on this carbon-intensive sector,"" the note said. ""Alternatively, some investors that might have encountered pressure to dispose of direct investment in oil & gas may get a reprieve.""

The stark contrast between them shows the industry is still grappling with how to meet the challenges ahead. BP Plc’s new Chief Executive Bernard Looney set out an ambitious plan for the oil and gas giant to achieve a zero net emissions goal by 2050, saying the company needed to “reinvent” itself. In a far less splashy announcement, Rio Tinto, the world’s second-largest mining company, said it was committing A$98 million ($65 million) to building a solar farm and battery storage system at a remote iron ore mine in Western Australia. The BP announcement garnered vast media attention, as perhaps was appropriate given the sheer ambition of the target and the status of the company involved. The Rio statement received some relatively minor coverage in the Australian press and the specialist renewable energy media, but little beyond that. In essence, what happened is that BP made an announcement long on promise but short on detail, while Rio’s statement was big on detail, but limited in ambition. The BP announcement could be easily attacked by critics as just another attempt at “greenwashing” by a big company whose products are carbon emissions intensive. Certainly, BP copped flak for the lengthy time frame and the lack of a clear plan, and not just from environmental activists. Glencore Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg was scathing of BP’s announcement, saying that 2050 was a “long way to go, and we don’t want to come out with wishy-washy ideas.” In some ways it may seem a bit rich for Glasenberg to be throwing stones from his glass house of being the company that exports the most thermal coal in the world, but he does have a point. What activists, and increasingly shareholders and financiers want to see is concrete plans and targets, and details of how resource companies intend to get there. Glencore said it will cut emissions by 30% within 15 years, including the Scope 3 emissions released by the consumers of its products. Emissions are divided by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol into Scope 1, which are emissions released during direct operations, Scope 2 are those from indirect sources, such as the electricity bought to make a product, and Scope 3 are those emitted by end users of the product. Up until recently most mining and oil companies were more focused on Scope 1 emissions, believing that those were mostly within their control, but there is a growing realization that accounting for Scope 2 and 3 is increasingly a focus of investors, governments and activists. BP has said it will provide a more detailed breakdown of how it will achieve its net zero emissions by September, and perhaps the company should be given the benefit of the doubt until this is released. But the less than positive reaction to BP’s announcement underscored the risks to companies that operate in emissions intensive industries. While BP may well be planning to “walk the talk”, for now it remains an example of the public relations effort seemingly getting ahead of the actual actions. In contrast, Rio may be somewhat disappointed it didn’t receive more kudos for its solar plans, which is the company’s first such facility. Rio said the plant will supply about 65% of the electricity to the Koodaideri mine, cutting annual carbon emissions equivalent to 28,000 cars.

The oil company announced it’s leaving three American trade associations as it aims to hit net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.  Story at a glance Oil giant BP is parting ways with three U.S. trade groups over disagreements on climate policies, as the company recently announced plans to hit net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and its support of goals outlined in the Paris Agreement.  The British oil and gas giant announced Wednesday it will not renew its membership with the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, the Western Energy Alliance and the Western States Petroleum Association.  BP said in a statement Wednesday that the decision to leave the associations follows an in-depth review assessing the alignment between the company’s position on climate change and the energy transition, and the views held by 30 key trade associations to which it belongs.  BP is withdrawing from Western Energy Alliance because of the group’s opposition to the federal regulation of methane and cited opposition to carbon pricing as the reason for leaving AFPM and the Western States Petroleum Association.  The company acknowledged that some have lost trust in BP and the industry due to inconsistencies in public statements concerning the climate, as well as lobbying and advocacy. “If BP is to stand a chance of achieving our ambition, then we have to earn back people’s trust,” CEO Bernard Looney said in a statement.  BP did decide, however, to remain a member of American Petroleum Institute, a larger lobby group only partly aligned with the company’s climate policy. The move comes just weeks after the oil giant announced its intention to be carbon neutral by 2050. The company said it wants to slash its carbon and methane intensity by 50 percent and invest more in non-oil and gas businesses.    A new analysis found carbon dioxide emissions dropped by about 100 million metric tons.

And when differences arise we will be transparent. But if our views cannot be reconciled, we will be prepared to part company,” the company's CEO, Bernard Looney, said in a statement. BP’s decision follows a six-month review of trade associations’ climate-related activities and positions. While the company will maintain membership in 30 other organizations, BP “found misalignments that could not be reconciled” with the other three. Part of BP’s neutrality goal calls for a price on carbon, one area in which AFPM and the company were not in agreement. AFPM CEO Chet Thompson said that the group was disappointed with BP’s decision. “As a member of our executive committee they know that AFPM is and has been committed to supporting policies that address climate change. Because of that, it leads us to assume that this decision was made based on factors other than our actual positions on the issues,” he said in a statement. WEA said it was never contacted by BP. ""If BP had worked with us in advance of the report, it would have realized its assessment on reducing methane emissions is likely at least partially aligned,"" WEA President Kathleen Sgamma said in an email to The Hill.  ""We do not suffer from a crisis of conscience that comes from listening to groups that want to keep all oil and natural gas in the ground. ... We are proud to stand up for the oil and natural gas industry and educate the public on all the benefits we provide to society.""  As part of the report, BP also contacted five organizations with which their climate views are only partially aligned, including the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. BP's announcement was made the same day as a report that found BP’s 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill was even larger than previously known.  It also comes amid a growing push on and within the financial sector to withhold funding for fossil fuel projects.  In January, investment firm BlackRock announced it would no longer invest in coal, and on Monday, JPMorgan Chase announced plans to stop approving loans to companies pursuing drilling in the Arctic Circle.

""The world's carbon budget is finite and running out fast,"" said CEO Bernard Looney, who stepped into BP's top job this month, in a statement Wednesday. ""We need a rapid transition to net zero. We all want energy that is reliable and affordable, but that is no longer enough."" He followed up with a post on Instagram: ""Simply put, we have got to change. We want to change. And we will change."" The company pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions from its global operations, as well as emissions that result from the oil and gas it produces, to net zero by 2050. By that same date, BP aims to halve the carbon intensity of the products it sells. Details about how BP (BP) will reach these goals remain scant. Looney said that the company would provide further details on its plans at a presentation in September. Still, the commitments are the most ambitious from any major oil company to date. Shell (RDSA) has set targets to rein in emissions from its products, but doesn't go as far, while America's Chevron (CVX) and ExxonMobil (XOM) lag far behind. ""They really are setting a new standard for what leadership looks like in the industry,"" said Andrew Logan, senior director of oil and gas at Ceres, a nonprofit that lobbies for companies to take action on climate change. BP will also overhaul its corporate structure in order to pursue its new strategy. Logan said this shows the company is serious about reaching its targets. In a note to clients, Barclays analysts called the changes under Looney ""fundamental and radical."" ""For us, the statement represents a steep change in terms of vision for the company, and one that moves the group towards the biggest reorganization and modernization in at least two decades, if not a century,"" they wrote. ""The magnitude and radical nature of this shift should not be underestimated.""  The announcement comes as investors and activists are calling for oil and gas companies to get in line with the commitments made in the Paris climate agreement, which aims to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius. Climate Action 100+, a group of investors leading the push who collectively manage more than $39 trillion in assets, applauded BP's decision. ""This is a very welcome announcement from BP's new CEO,"" said Stephanie Pfeifer, a member of the group's steering committee and CEO of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change. ""We need to see a wholesale shift to a net zero economy by 2050. This must include oil and gas companies if we are to have any chance of successfully tackling the climate crisis.""

""We all want energy that is reliable and affordable, but that is no longer enough. It must also be cleaner. To deliver that, trillions of dollars will need to be invested in replumbing and rewiring the world’s energy system. It will require nothing short of reimagining energy as we know it."" BP, the London-based multinational company, is the largest oil and gas company to pledge to go carbon-neutral by mid-century. The Spanish energy company Repsol announced a similar goal in December 2019. The 2050 commitment is in line with a target world leaders agreed to in the Paris climate agreement to cut global emissions to net-zero by the second half of the century. The company's new climate announcement comes as fossil fuel companies face increasing pressure from activists, stakeholders, and city and state officials looking to hold them accountable for a warming planet. BP is one of several companies being sued by multiple US cities and states for climate impacts. BP reported profits of $10 billion in 2019, a decrease from the previous year due to lower oil and gas prices. Activists expressed caution on whether to celebrate the oil giant's announcement before knowing specifics on how they planned to achieve such a massive change. ""The oil industry writ large is struggling for social license right now,"" Kert Davies, climate activist and founder of Climate Investigations Center, told BuzzFeed News. ""Any move like this has to be looked at with a critical eye to see if it's greenwashing or if it's real."" As part of its new climate strategy, BP says it will install equipment at all major oil and gas processing sites to measure emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, by 2023. The company did not define what constitutes a major processing site. BP also pledged to ""reduce methane intensity of operations by 50%,"" but did not offer an exact timeline. Perhaps the most encouraging part of BP's announcement is its plan to make cuts to the emissions associated with consumers using the company's products, such as the burning of fossil fuels to drive cars, according to Andrew Logan, senior director of oil and gas at the sustainability nonprofit Ceres. These product emissions, called ""Scope 3"" in industry lingo, make up the lion's share of the company's total climate pollution footprint. BP emits about 55 million tonnes of emissions from operations and 360 million from the oil and gas the company produced by the company and sold to consumers, Looney said in the announcement. He said those emissions will be fully covered by the new net zero goal. But BP also buys oil from other producers that it uses for refining, as well as fuels produced by others, and the significant emissions tied to that oil and gas won't be cut as dramatically under the new strategy. In an email with BuzzFeed News, company spokesman David Nicholas estimated BP's total product emissions, including oil and gas bought from other producers, was about 1 billion tonnes. Additionally, the oil company has vowed to increase its investment in non-oil and gas business over time, to advocate for pro-climate policies, such as carbon pricing, to be more transparent in its climate reporting, and more. BP America, a subsidiary of BP, contributed nearly $13 million to a group opposing a 2018 Washington state ballot initiative that proposed charging companies for their climate pollution. The climate initiative was defeated. The new announcement offered few details on how exactly the company, whose business is currently reliant on the production and burning of fossil fuels, a major contributor to climate change, will meet these bold goals. BP said it will set out its strategy and near-term plans in September. According to Logan, BP's climate efforts laid out today represent a ""raising of the bar in the oil industry about what a strong climate strategy could look like."" But right now, he said, ""it's just a vision and a lot will depend on the details."" “Looney deserves support and credit for starting BP on the journey towards carbon neutrality and policy leadership. The direction is good, and we look forward to hearing more about the specifics,"" Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, said in a statement. ""Time will tell if he gets BP where it needs to go. It’s real actions and verifiable emissions reductions that will be the measure of success.” This story has been updated to include BP's estimated climate emissions.",https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zahrahirji/bp-carbon-neutral-looney,,Buzzfeed News
883,2020-02-12 00:00:00,2020,2.0,12,Justine Calma,BP wants to somehow eliminate its greenhouse gas emissions ,"Oil company BP says it will try to cancel out nearly all its greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. It’s still unclear how a company that sells the stuff that heats up the planet — it plans to continue pumping out fossil fuels despite this announcement — will achieve that net-zero goal. The company says its ambition is to slash emissions from its operations and from the burning of the fossil fuels it sells. It will also invest more in alternatives to oil and gas over time, although it didn’t set out a deadline for the transition. BP also announced plans to fundamentally restructure the company in order to achieve its aims. “Trillions of dollars will need to be invested in replumbing and rewiring the world’s energy system. It will require nothing short of reimagining energy as we know it,” CEO Bernard Looney said in a statement. But exactly what form that reimagining will take remains to be seen. The company is one of the largest oil and gas companies in the world. It produced about 8.6 million cubic feet of natural gas per day in 2018, and 2.64 million barrels of oil equivalent every day in 2019. In a Q&A, Looney said that the company would “very likely” still be producing and refining hydrocarbons by 2050, but that it planned to invest “less and less in oil and gas” over time. It’s easier for a company to reign in emissions from its direct operations; many companies making net-zero pledges have stopped short of counting the climate pollution generated from customers using their products, called “Scope 3 emissions.” This is even tricker for an oil company like BP, which makes its money by selling emissions-generating fuels. The company now says it wants to get rid of the greenhouse gases that come from burning its oil and gas after it’s sold. The overwhelming majority of BP’s emissions come from customers burning its fuels, Bloomberg reports. Important clarification from BP spokesperson: The BP climate plan includes cutting majority of Scope 3 emissions, about 360 million tons out of the 437 million tons That is, net zero on oil and gas BP extracts and sells. But not yet on crude it buys, refines, and sells. As the climate crisis worsens, lawsuits have been aimed at Big Oil and Gas while activists and politicians have called for a switch to renewables. Reactions to BP’s latest announcement from people advocating for change have been mixed. Some investors have hailed the net-zero announcement as groundbreaking, but others have been unimpressed. “This isn’t ambitious or anywhere near enough,” Greenpeace UK said in response to BP on Twitter. With its new goal, BP appears to be making the case that fossil fuels can somehow still power the future — it just needs to figure out its carbon dioxide problem. How, exactly, it’s going to do that — along with the greenhouse gases it’s responsible for — are still up in the air. The company plans to set out more of its strategy and short-term plans in September.

The decision comes after BP Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney, who took office earlier this month, set one of the oil sector’s most ambitious targets for curbing carbon emissions with a vow to “re-invent” the 111-year old company in the face of the climate challenge. The London-based company said in a report on Wednesday that it will quit the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM), following similar moves by other European rivals. BP will also not renew its membership in the Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA) and Western Energy Alliance (WEA), it said.

885,2020-02-26 00:00:00,2020,2.0,26,Ron Bousso,BP to quit main U.S. refining lobby over carbon policy,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP (BP.L) will leave the main U.S. refining lobby and two other trade groups as new Chief Executive Bernard Looney spurs some of the oil sector’s most ambitious targets for curbing carbon emissions. The decision follows a review of its membership in over 30 associations around the world, which Looney said in a post on Instagram was aimed at boosting people’s trust in the oil and gas company. “BP will pursue opportunities to work with organisations who share our ambitious and progressive approach to the energy transition,” Looney said in a statement. BP said its view on carbon pricing, which it says is key in the energy transition, were “at odds” with those of the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM), which has around 300 members. “Currently we have no areas of full alignment,” BP said. It will also not renew its membership in the Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA) and Western Energy Alliance (WEA). “AFPM is and has been committed to supporting policies that address climate change,” said AFPM Chief Executive Chet Thompson. “Because of that, it leads us to assume that this decision was made based on factors other than our actual positions on the issues.” Bruce Duguid, head of stewardship at Federated Hermes, which has led talks with BP on shareholder climate resolutions in recent years, welcomed the move. “Supportive public policy is vital to achieving BP’s bold vision to become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner,” Duguid said in a statement. BP has called for placing a price on carbon emissions in order to push out the most polluting fossil fuel production including coal and encourage investment in renewable energy. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Total (TOTF.PA) last year both said they would not renew their memberships in the AFPM. BP, one of the largest U.S. refiners and petrochemical producers and fuel retailers, will a member of the American Petroleum Institute, the country’s largest energy association, drawing criticism from climate campaigners. “The industry’s response to climate change is the key question that will define their performance and viability,” Ben Ratner, senior director at Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) told Reuters. BP, Shell and others that in recent years have been investing in cleaner fuel technology have also opposed AFPM’s efforts to oppose standards requiring refiners to blend or subsidise the blending of biofuels into the gasoline pool, saying it hurts independent refiners. The AFPM has around 300 U.S. and international members including Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp which operate 110 refineries and 229 petrochemical plants, its 2018 annual report showed.

886,2020-02-26 00:00:00,2020,2.0,26,Ron Bousso,BP to quit main U.S. refining lobby over carbon policy,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP (BP.L) will leave the main U.S. refining lobby and two other trade groups as new Chief Executive Bernard Looney spurs some of the oil sector’s most ambitious targets for curbing carbon emissions. The decision follows a review of its membership in over 30 associations around the world, which Looney said in a post on Instagram was aimed at boosting people’s trust in the oil and gas company. “BP will pursue opportunities to work with organisations who share our ambitious and progressive approach to the energy transition,” Looney said in a statement. BP said its view on carbon pricing, which it says is key in the energy transition, were “at odds” with those of the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM), which has around 300 members. “Currently we have no areas of full alignment,” BP said. It will also not renew its membership in the Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA) and Western Energy Alliance (WEA). “AFPM is and has been committed to supporting policies that address climate change,” said AFPM Chief Executive Chet Thompson. “Because of that, it leads us to assume that this decision was made based on factors other than our actual positions on the issues.” Bruce Duguid, head of stewardship at Federated Hermes, which has led talks with BP on shareholder climate resolutions in recent years, welcomed the move. “Supportive public policy is vital to achieving BP’s bold vision to become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner,” Duguid said in a statement. BP has called for placing a price on carbon emissions in order to push out the most polluting fossil fuel production including coal and encourage investment in renewable energy. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Total (TOTF.PA) last year both said they would not renew their memberships in the AFPM. BP, one of the largest U.S. refiners and petrochemical producers and fuel retailers, will a member of the American Petroleum Institute, the country’s largest energy association, drawing criticism from climate campaigners. “The industry’s response to climate change is the key question that will define their performance and viability,” Ben Ratner, senior director at Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) told Reuters. BP, Shell and others that in recent years have been investing in cleaner fuel technology have also opposed AFPM’s efforts to oppose standards requiring refiners to blend or subsidise the blending of biofuels into the gasoline pool, saying it hurts independent refiners. The AFPM has around 300 U.S. and international members including Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp which operate 110 refineries and 229 petrochemical plants, its 2018 annual report showed. Exxon said it routinely evaluates trade group memberships on an annual basis. Chevron did not immediately respond to a request for comment. BP operates three U.S. refineries including the 430,000 barrels per day Whiting, Indiana plant, its largest.

Australia’s conservative government is working on policies to develop carbon capture and storage (CCS), projects where carbon dioxide (CO2) is reinjected underground out of the atmosphere, to meet its Paris Climate Accord commitments to cut carbon emissions. Santos, Australia’s second-largest independent gas producer, has begun engineering studies on a CCS project in the Cooper Basin in central Australia which would inject 1.7 million tonnes a year of CO2 into a former gas reservoir. “With the world demanding more hydrocarbons for at least the next two decades, any serious response to climate change must include pathways to make these fuels cleaner,” Santos Ltd (STO.AX) Chief Executive Kevin Gallagher said in a statement on Wednesday. The Cooper Basin project could eventually be expanded to inject 20 million tonnes a year. That would be five times bigger than Australia’s only operating CCS project, a A$2 billion ($1.3 billion) site at the Gorgon LNG plant off Western Australia operated by Chevron Corp (CVX.N), also the world’s biggest commercial CCS site. BP (BP.L) on Wednesday committed to invest A$20 million in Santos’ project. “We believe CCS has an important role to play in meeting the objectives of the Paris Agreement,” BP’s Managing Director Exploration and Production Australia Emil Ismayilov said in a statement with Santos on the non-binding agreement. The two companies announced their agreement ahead of a CCS policy forum in Canberra led by the private CO2CRC, an organization originally set up under a government research program. Santos said last month it could make a final investment decision on the Cooper Basin project by the end of 2020 but would only go ahead “subject to the required Government policy being in place”. Another CCS project is being run by coal miner Glencore Plc (GLEN.L) in the state of Queensland, which could also reach a final investment decision later this year. A third project, already being supported by the Australian government, is a Japanese-backed plan to produce hydrogen from brown coal, with the CO2 stored under the Bass Strait. Policies sought by CO2CRC include tax credits for storing and using CO2 and carbon credits for stored CO2 which could be sold in the government’s Emissions Reduction Fund program. “There’s got to be an economic value attached to sequestering CO2. If you change that dynamic, you change the commercial conditions, then you’ll find more projects able to be justified,” CO2CRC Chief Executive David Byers told Reuters. The group also wants the government to allow its Clean Energy Finance Corp to finance CCS. In a speech last week, Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor said he is working on a “technology roadmap” to move government investments away from wind and solar to hydrogen and CCS. He said the aim would be to advance technologies to full commerciality as fast as possible, “without massive government subsidies once full scale deployment is viable.” Green groups on Wednesday urged the government to rule out CCS subsidies. “Carbon capture and storage is nothing more than a pipe dream of the coal and gas lobby designed to divert money away from affordable, reliable and proven renewable energy technology,” Lucy Manne, chief executive of anti-fossil fuel group 350 Australia, said in a statement.

The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sent the case back to the federal judge in New Orleans who is overseeing the multidistrict litigation, saying he failed to consider whether BP had offered “credible evidence” that Trammo’s proof-of-loss form was skewed solely because the price of fertilizer had spiked in the benchmark year of 2008.

891,2020-03-04 00:00:00,2020,3.0,4,,ValueAct's Jeffrey Ubben buys BP and says oil company can be 'part of the solution',"As the sustainable investing movement gains traction investors have increasingly shied away from traditional energy stocks. But ValueAct Capital's Jeffrey Ubben believes that oil and gas companies that are working to clean up their operations can belong in portfolios focused on sustainable companies. The activist investor, who is the co-portfolio manager of the ValueAct Spring Fund, said that he's been buying shares of BP since the company is working to instate more environmentally-friendly policies. ""They can be part of the solution. They can move to carbon capture, and hydrogen and other things with their capital spend to become a company of the future,"" he told CNBC's David Faber on Wednesday. From a more traditional investing perspective, he noted that the company has done a ""great job"" in the last three years financially and has a ""fine"" balance sheet.  As the energy sector faces mounting pressure from investors, BP in February announced that it plans to be carbon neutral by 2050. Even as BP works to make its operations more environmentally friendly, Ubben noted that given how out of favor the sector is with investors, it could be hard to find a buyer on the other side. The sector has shed 28% over the last year, compared with the S&P 500's 12% gain. But Ubben also said that as an investor it's possible to push for meaningful change, which is why companies like BP can be included in ESG portfolios. The popular acronym denotes when a company's environmental, social and governance factors are taken into consideration when someone is choosing whether or not to buy a stock. ""My new activist hat says let's go find the right investors,"" he said, meaning that rather than pushing the company to buyback shares, for example, stock owners should instead encourage things like capital re-allocation. ""We need to make it more investable, that's all, and we can. ... Stock price creates the impetus for change. When your stock price gets that low your strategy probably isn't working,"" he said.

897,2020-03-16 00:00:00,2020,3.0,16,,"As oil prices tank, BP CFO warns demand could be negative in 2020","Demand for oil will likely be negative in 2020, adding further downward pressure to plummeting prices, according to BP CFO Brian Gilvary. Around the time of its earnings report in early February, the energy giant anticipated that demand would weaken by around 300,000 to 500,000 barrels a day. But on Monday, Gilvary told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"": ""If you ask me that question today, it is more like flat demand year-on-year, maybe even negative demand - we will probably likely see negative demand this year."" This would mean that demand for oil actually contracts this year — a very rare occurrence — rather than just growing at a slower rate than previously expected. The combination of an unfolding price war between oil production giants Russia and Saudi Arabia and concern over a potential demand shock from the global coronavirus pandemic have hammered oil prices in recent weeks. International benchmark Brent crude was trading down 9.3% at around $30.70 per barrel on Monday afternoon while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) dipped below $30 a barrel to $29.50, down 6.8%. So far this year, Brent and WTI are down 53.8% and 52% respectively. The tension between OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC leader Russia arose after a recent breakdown in negotiations over oil production cuts in response to the outbreak. Riyadh subsequently vowed to ramp up production at sharply discounted prices for April. Gilvary suggested that activity beyond this year would depend on what ""the new normal"" becomes for businesses. ""We have got a demand side shock and then you also have the combined issue of a significant amount of oil now coming on the market in April, so the direction of the oil price can only go in one direction, and that is down,"" he said. Gilvary said that at present, BP was starting from a ""much stronger financial position"" in terms of costs and capital flexibility than when Brent prices fell to $28 per barrel in 2016. ""In our targets for 2021, we had the company balanced at around $40 per barrel Brent, which was the key five-year target we put in place four years ago. We are on track for that,"" Gilvary said, adding that BP's capital was currently running at around $15 billion and could be taken down by up to 20% this year if necessary.",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/16/as-oil-prices-tank-bp-cfo-warns-demand-could-be-negative-in-2020.html,Oil and Gas,CNBC

Capital spending for this year would be reduced to $1.2 billion and exploration spending to $400 million, while in 2021-2022 it expects capital spending to be “well below” $1 billion. It also aimed to cut production costs by around 20% to $7-8 per barrel of oil equivalent by postponing all non-critical activities, such as maintenance, it added. “With the measures we are now undertaking, Aker BP is well prepared to face the challenging market situation, and we have the financial resources to pursue value accretive growth opportunities ahead,” Aker BP’s Chief Executive Karl Johnny Hersvik said. The planned measures, which include postponement of the Hod and Valhall field redevelopment projects, are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s production capacity in 2020, and its guidance of 205,000-220,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day remained unchanged, Aker BP said. The company said its ambition to continue paying dividends “remained firm”, but the board still had to assess the impact on its balance sheet and liquidity from the coronavirus and oil price fall. Aker BP had previously planned to pay $850 million in dividends in 2020, increasing payouts by $100 million each year until 2023.

BP and climate-focused Follow This have agreed to jointly draft a shareholder resolution on BP’s climate goals for its 2021 annual general meeting (AGM), they said in a statement on Friday. Follow This agreed to pull a resolution it filed independently ahead of BP’s 2020 AGM, planned for May. The move comes after BP Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney outlined shortly after taking office in February plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from BP’s own oil and gas production to net zero by 2050.
